         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE To the ENGLISH READER.</head>
            <p>SEveral of the Writings of this Author <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob Behme</hi> have been publiſhed in his native Tongue the <hi>German,</hi> and were ſo loved and deſired, at the firſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them, about the year <hi>1612.</hi> by ſome noble, vertuous and learned <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> who procured Tranſcripts out of the <hi>Library</hi> at <hi>Gerlity,</hi> where the Primate <hi>Gregory Rickter</hi> had commanded it to be kept, that it ſhould <hi>no more</hi> come to the Authors hands again: that beyond his <hi>expectation</hi> they wrote to him, to know whether he were the Author of them; and upon his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> in return, they ceaſed not to <hi>ſolicite</hi> him to further

            </p>
            <p>For, it appears by the Hiſtory of his life, and in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue printed at the end of his Book in <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the forty Queſtions of the Soul; that he wrote to the number of <hi>Thirty One ſeveral Treaties,</hi> whereof ſome have been ſtudyed by perſons of Learning, ſome Miniſters as well as others, in <hi>Muſcovia, Sweden, Poland, Denmark,</hi> the <hi>Netherlands, Germany, France, Spain, Italy,</hi> even in the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>
                        <label>The Firſt Text.</label>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. WE ſee and find, that Every Life is <hi>Eſſential;</hi> and find alſo, that it ſtandeth in a <hi>Will,</hi> for, the will, is the driving forth of the Eſſences.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And thus we are to conceive, as if a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fire lay in the <hi>willing,</hi> where the will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually lifteth it ſelf up towards the fire, and and would awaken and kindle that.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For we underſtand, that every Will, without the awakening of the fiery Eſſences, is an <hi>Inability,</hi> as it were inanimate or Mute without Life, wherein is no feeling, underſtanding or ſubſtantiality.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. For it is only like a <hi>Shadow</hi> without Subſtance; for it hath no<note n="†" place="margin">Of its own in it ſelf.</note> dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but it ſinketh down and ſuffers it ſelf to be driven and lead as a Dead thing or Subſtance; as is to be apprehended in a Shadow, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh<note n="*" place="margin">As a Thought is drawn or pourtrayed in the Mind.</note> lead about <hi>without Eſſence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Thus, an uneſſential will is an inanimate or Mute being or ſubſtance; without comprehenſion and Life; and yet is a <hi>Figure,</hi> in the Abyſſal Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Nothing; for it cleaveth or adhereth to Corporeal Things.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Now as the Will without Eſſence is inanimate without being or Subſtance, ſo in the Eſſence it is a being or Subſtance and Image, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Eſſences, which becometh Imaged according to the Eſſences: for the <hi>willing Life</hi> becometh generated out of the <hi>Eſſences.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61437:12"/>7. Thus, the Life is the Sonne of the Eſſences and the will wherein the Lifes figure ſtandeth, is the Father of the Eſſences, for no Eſſence <hi>can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt</hi> without willing; for in the willing, the Deſiring becometh Origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in which the Eſſences originally ariſe.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Seeing then, the <hi>firſt will,</hi> is an Abyſſe, to be eſteemed as an Eternal Nothing; therefore we apprehend it to be <hi>like</hi> a Looking-Glaſs, in which one ſeeth his own Image like a Life, and yet is no Life, but a Figure of the Life, and of the Image to the Life.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Thus we apprehend the Eternal Abyſſe without and beyond Nature to be like a Looking-Glaſs, for it is <hi>like</hi> an<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>AVGE.</hi> An Eye. ☉</note> 
                        <hi>AVGE</hi> Eye, which there ſeeth, &amp; yet bringeth nothing into the Seeing, wherewith it ſeeth; for <hi>the ſeeing</hi> is without being or ſubſtance, whereas yet it becometh ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated out of being or ſubſtance, <hi>viz:</hi> out of the Eſſential being or Subſtance.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Thus, it is apprehenſible to us, that the Eternal Abyſſe without or beyond Nature, is a Will, like an Eye, wherein Nature lieth hidden, like <hi>an hidden fire that burneth not,</hi> which there, is, and is not.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. It is not a Spirit, but a<note n="*" place="margin">Figure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, or portraiture.</note> form of a Spirit, like the<note n="*" place="margin">Or a Glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow like a Thought, or Shape, Reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion or Aſpect in a well gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed or clear Looking-Glaſs.</note> Shimmering Glimps or Reflexion in the Looking-Glaſs, where <hi>all</hi> manner of <hi>forms</hi> of a Spirit is ſeen in the ſhimmering Glimps, reflexion, or Looking Glaſs.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. And yet there is nothing which the Eye or Looking-Glaſs ſeeth; but its ſeeing is <hi>in it ſelf;</hi> for there is nothing before it, which is deeper there.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. It is like a Looking-Glaſs, which is a retainer of the Aſpect of Nature, yet it doth not comprehend Nature, neither doth Nature comprehend the ſhimmering Glimps or Reflexion in the Looking-Glaſs; and thus the one is free from the other; and yet the Looking-Glaſs is really the retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or <hi>preſerver of the Image.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. It compriſeth the Image, and yet is impotent in reſpect of the ſhim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering Glimps or Reflexion, for it cannot retain the ſhimmering Glimps or Reflexion: for if the <hi>Image departeth</hi> away from the Looking-Glaſs; then is the Looking-Glaſs a meer Glaſs; and the Glance <hi>Shadow</hi> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion is a Nothing; and yet all Forms of Nature lie hidden therein as it were Nothing and yet is truly and Entally or really, but <hi>not</hi> Eſſentially.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Thus we are to apprehend &amp; underſtand concerning the <hi>Eternal wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of God, which thus<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> reſembleth an Eternal Eye without Being or Subſtance: it is the Abyſſe and yet ſeeth all; all hath ſtood hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in it from Eternity, whence it hath its ſeeing; But it is not Eſſential: As the Glance ſhadow or Reflexion in the Looking-Glaſs is not Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and yet that receiveth, catcheth, or compriſeth that which <hi>appeareth</hi> before it.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. And then ſecondly, as concerning the <hi>Eternal willing</hi> which is alſo without being or Subſtance, we are in like manner to underſtand concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> for No Seeing is without Spirit, alſo no Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Seeing.</p>
                     <p n="17">
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61437:12"/>17. And underſtand thus, that the Seeing appeareth out of <hi>the Spirit,</hi> which is its Eye or Looking-Glaſs, wherein the will is revealed or mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt; for the Seeing maketh a <hi>will.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="18">18. Thus, the Abyſſe of the Deep, without Number, knoweth to find no Ground nor limit, and therefore its Looking-Glaſs goeth into it ſelf, and maketh a Ground in it ſelf, that is, a <hi>Will.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="19">19. Thus, the Looking-Glaſs of the Eternal Eye appeareth in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and Generateth to it ſelf an Eternal Ground in it ſelf, that is, its <hi>Center</hi> or heart, out of which the ſeeing continually ariſeth from Eternity: and thereby the will becometh ſtirring and driving forth, <hi>viz:</hi> of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>Center</hi> Generateth.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. For, it all becometh catched or comprehended in the willing, and is a Being or <hi>Subſtance,</hi> which Eternally ariſeth in the Eternal Abyſſe in it ſelf; and entreth into it ſelf, and maketh the Center in it ſelf; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth catcheth or Compriſeth it ſelf in it ſelf, but goeth with that which is compriſed out of it ſelf forth, and revealeth or Manifeſteth it ſelf in the Glance Shadow or Reflexion of the Eye, and ſo <hi>appeareth</hi> out of the being or ſubſtance, in it ſelf, and out of it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. It is its <hi>own,</hi> yet in reſpect of Nature it is as a Nothing: underſtand, in reſpect of the <hi>Comprehenſible</hi> or palpable being or ſubſtance, as a Man may ſay; whereas yet it is ALL, and all originally ariſeth from thence.</p>
                     <p n="22">22.<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> And we underſtand here, the Eternal Being or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Deity, with the Abyſſal Wiſdom: for, the Eternal will which catcheth or compriſeth the Eye; <hi>viz:</hi> the Looking-Glaſs wherein the Eternal Seeing ſtandeth, <hi>viz:</hi> the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; is the <hi>Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="23">23. And the Eternal Compriſed or catched, in the Wiſdom; where the Catching or Compriſing, in it ſelf compriſeth a Ground or Center, out of the Abyſſe into a Ground, is the <hi>Form</hi> or Heart; for it is the Word of Life, or its <hi>Subſtantiality,</hi> wherein the Will with the Glance or Reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion <hi>appeareth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="24">24. And the Entering into it ſelf to the Center of the Ground; is the <hi>Spirit:</hi> for it is the finder, which there <hi>findeth</hi> continually from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where nothing is; and that goeth again from the Center of the Ground Forth, &amp; ſeeketh in the willing, and then the Looking-Glaſs of the Eye, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fathers and Sonnes Wiſdom becometh Manifeſt: and thus the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ſtandeth before the Spirit of God<note n="*" place="margin">Which ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> which the Abyſſe manifeſteth in<note n="†" place="margin">Or her, <hi>viz;</hi> the wiſdom.</note> it.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. For, its vertue wherein the <hi>Colours of the</hi>

                        <hi>Wonders appear</hi> becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth manifeſt out of the Father of the Eternal willing, through the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his heart or ground with the out-going Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. For<note n="†" place="margin">The Eternal Wiſdom.</note> it is the <hi>outſpoken,</hi> which the Father ſpeaketh forth out of the Center of the Heart with or by the Holy Spirit, and ſtandeth in the divine <hi>Formings</hi> and Images, in the Sight of the Eye of the Holy Trinity of God: yet as a <hi>Virgin</hi> without generating.</p>
                     <p n="27">
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61437:13"/>27. It generateth not the Colours which appear in it, &amp; ſtand manifeſt in the Ground and Being or Subſtance; But All is together an Eternal <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> and dwelleth with the Center of the Heart, in it ſelf; and with the Spirit out of the Center it goeth forth out of it ſelf, and manifeſteth it ſelf in the Eye of the Virgin-like Wiſdom <hi>in infinitum</hi> End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. For, as the Being or Subſtance of the Deity, hath no ground, out of which it ariſeth or proceedeth: ſo alſo the will-Spirit hath no ground, wherein it might Reſt, where there might be any place or limit; but it is called<note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 9.6.</note> 
                        <hi>Wonderful,</hi> and its Word or Heart from which it goeth forth, is called the Eternal <hi>Power</hi> of the Deity; and the will which generateth the Heart or power in it ſelf, is called Eternal <hi>Council.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="29">29. Thus is the Being or Subſtance of the Deity, in all places and Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Deep of the Abyſſe, <hi>as a Wheel or</hi>

                     <p n="31">31.

Fourthly, And yet the Eternal Geniture or Birth of the Word in the Will in the Looking-Glaſs of the Eternal <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> viz: in the Virgin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out generating or bringing forth; is continually effected or produced from Eternity to Eternity.</p>
                     <p n="35">35. In this Virgin of the Wiſdom of God, is the Eternal Principle, as a <hi>hidden Fire,</hi> which becometh thus appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended as in a Looking-Glaſs, in its Colours; and hath been known from Eternity to Eternity in the <hi>Figure;</hi> and alſo thus becometh known in all Eternity in the Eternal Original in the Wiſdom.</p>
                     <p n="36">36.

                     <p n="37">37. And now it is to be underſtood thus; that the Firſt Principle, in the Original is<note n="*" place="margin">See the ſmall ſix Points. <hi>Verſe. 65.</hi> the word Magical.</note> 
                        <hi>Magicall:</hi> for it becometh generated in the deſiring in the willing, from thence then to generate its ſeeking or Longing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>oppoſite</hi> will.</p>
                     <p n="38">38. And ſeeing then in the firſt and ſecond Principle it is only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as a ſpirit, without comprehenſible or <hi>palpable</hi> being or ſubſtance: therefore the ſeeking or Longing is further, to generate the <hi>Third</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; where the Spirit of the Principles might reſt, and manifeſt it ſelf therein in <hi>Similitude.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="39">39. And although each Principle hath its Center, yet the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple ſtandeth in the Magical ſource or quality, and its Centre is <hi>Fire,</hi> which cannot ſubſiſt without Subſtance, and therefore its hunger and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring is after <hi>Subſtance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="40">40. And it is to be underſtood concerning or as to the firſt Principle, if we ſpeak meerly of One, though it is not One alone: that the Abyſſal will in the Center of the Abyſſe, as wherein the Eternal Word continually becometh <hi>generated</hi> from Eternity, is, <hi>deſirous;</hi> for the Will deſireth the Center or Heart.</p>
                     <p n="41">41. Secondly it deſireth that the Heart might be manifeſt, for in the Abyſſe there is no manifeſtation or revelation: but an Eternal Nothing; a <hi>ſtilneſs</hi> or <hi>vacuum</hi> without Being or Subſtance or Colours and Vertues.</p>
                     <p n="42">42. But in this <hi>deſiring,</hi> Colours powers and vertues come to be, and yet is thus only hidden in it ſelf; and if it ſhould Eternally not be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, then there would be no Light, Luſtre Bright Glance or Majeſty, but a Threefold Spirit <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> which would be without ſource or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any Being or Subſtance.</p>
                     <p n="43">
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61437:14"/>43. And thus, is the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the Deepeſt Deity without beyond or beſides Nature.</p>
                     <p n="44">44. And further: the Eternal Will of the Deity, deſireth to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt it ſelf out of its own Byſſe or Ground in the Light of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
                     <p n="45">45. Where then, the firſt will of the Father to the Son, and to the Light of the Majeſty is apprehended to be deſirous; and that in <hi>two wayes;</hi> the Firſt way, to the Centre of the <hi>Word,</hi> the Second to the <hi>Light</hi> of the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation or Revelation.</p>
                     <p n="46">46. For every deſiring is attractive, though in the Abyſſe there is No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which there can be drawn, yet therefore the Deſiring <hi>draweth it ſelf,</hi> and impregnateth the <hi>Second</hi> willing of the Father, which <hi>Imagineth</hi> to the Light of the Majeſty, out of the Center of his word or Heart.</p>
                     <p n="47">47. And now is the Heart impregnated with the <hi>Light,</hi> and the firſt will impregnated with <hi>Nature:</hi> and yet thus there would be no manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, if the <hi>Principle</hi> were <hi>not</hi> generated.</p>
                     <p n="48">48. For, the Father generateth the firſt Principle out of the firſt willing, <hi>viz: Nature;</hi> which in the Fire, cometh to the <hi>higheſt</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                     <p n="49">49. And then he generateth the ſecond Principle, in and out of the ſecond willing to the Word; in that it deſireth the Manifeſtation or <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Word in the Light of the Majeſty, where the Fire of the Second Principle in the Light of the Majeſty is a fulfilling of the Second willing, <hi>viz.</hi> Meekneſs: which is ſet oppoſite to the fire of the firſt Principle, and <hi>quencheth</hi> its fierce wrath, and is put into an Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Subſtance, as into an Eternal Life; Where the Fire is hidden in the Light, and giveth the Light its Power, Strength, and Might, ſo that it is together an Eternal Band, and one without the other would not be.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="50">50. HEre the Deſiring is to be conſidered of: For every Deſiring is attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of <hi>that</hi> which is in the deſirous willing.</p>
                     <p n="51">
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61437:14"/>51. Yet now God deſireth <hi>only</hi> Light, <hi>viz:</hi> the <hi>Glance</hi> out of his Heart, that it may <hi>appear</hi> in the Wiſdome: and ſo the Total God as in himſelf, together with the outgoing Spirit out of it ſelf, may be manifeſted in the virgin of his Wiſdome; and that there be an Eternal <hi>perfect Joy,</hi> longing, or delight and <hi>fulfilling</hi> in<note n="*" place="margin">The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Spirit.</note> it.</p>
                     <p n="52">52. And this now can be no otherwiſe generated then through the <hi>fire,</hi> where the will becometh put into the deepeſt ſharpneſs of the <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> in that it becometh <hi>Conſuming</hi> in the Fire; On the contrary, the Light is a Meekneſs of <hi>Genetrix</hi> of the Omniſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality.</p>
                     <p n="53">53. Yet now the fire muſt have a <hi>Genetriae</hi> to its Original and Life, and ſo now in a twofold Life, and in <hi>two</hi> ſources or qualities; and they are rightly called two Principles; whereas yet it is but one only, but of a <hi>twofold</hi> ſource or quality in <hi>One</hi> ſubſtance, and in reſpect of the ſources or Qualities is accounted Two Subſtances, as is to be perceived by the Fire and Light.</p>
                     <p n="54">54. Therefore we now conſider of the Deſiring &amp; find that it is a ſtern ſtrong attraction, as an Eternal liſting up and <hi>moving,</hi> for it attracteth it Self in it ſelf, and impregnateth it ſelf, ſo that out of the Thinne or Rare <hi>Liberty,</hi> where nothing is, a <hi>Darkneſs</hi> cometh to be; For, the deſirous will, by the intraction becometh thick or denſe and full; whereas yet this alſo is nothing elſe, but Darkneſs.</p>
                     <p n="55">55. Now, the firſt Will, willeth to be free from the Darkneſs, for it deſireth Light, and yet cannot thus attain it, for the greater the deſiring is after the Liberty, the greater will the attraction be, and the <hi>Sting of the Eſſences</hi> which ariſe originally in the drawing.</p>
                     <p n="56">56. Thus, the will draweth the More in it ſelf and its impregnation becometh but the Greater, and yet the Darkneſs cannot comprehend the Center of the Word or Heart of the Number Three or Trinity, for that Center is <hi>a degree deeper</hi> in it ſelf, and yet is a Band.</p>
                     <p n="57">57. But the firſt Will, wherein the Impregnation of Nature originally ariſeth, <hi>is yet deeper</hi> then the Center of the Word, for it originally ariſeth out of the <hi>Eternall Abyſs</hi> or Nothing: And thus the Center of the Heart is ſhut up in the Midſt, where the firſt Will of the Father laboureth to the Fires Birth or Geniture.</p>
                     <p n="58">58. Thus now we are to apprehend, that in the ſtrong or ſtern attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, there is a very ſtern ſtrong Subſtance and Being, where then the ſubſtantiality exiſteth originally <hi>from Eternity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="59">59. For, the drawing giveth Sting, and the attracted giveth hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Matter; out of the Nothing a Subſtance and Subſtantiality: The ſting of the drawing <hi>dwelleth now</hi> in that very Subſtantiality, it ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth and breaketh; and all this from the deſirous willing which draweth.</p>
                     <p n="60">60. Thus now here we are to apprehend, <hi>Two</hi> formes of Nature, <hi>viz:</hi>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61437:15"/> the harſh or aſtringent, that is, the deſiring, and then the ſting, and that maketh in the deſiring, a ſtabbing and breaking, whence the <hi>feeling</hi> origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ariſeth, that is, bitter, which is the ſecond form of Nature, a cauſe and original of the Eſſences in Nature.</p>
                     <p n="61">61. Now ſeeing the firſt Will <hi>is not</hi> ſatiated with this, nor put into Reſt; but therewith becometh fet into a much greater anguiſh: For it deſireth the Liberty in the Light, and yet alſo there is <hi>no glance</hi> in the Liberty; Now therefore it is wrapped up in terrible anguiſh, and lifteth up the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring ſo very much after the Liberty, that the <hi>anguiſh,</hi> as a dying or ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down through Death, <hi>introduceth</hi> its willing into the Liberty out of the breaking ſtabbing and powerful attracting.</p>
                     <p n="62">62. Thus underſtand the willing here in <hi>two</hi> wayes; one which cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth up in the fierce wrathfulneſs, to the generating of the fierce <hi>wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fire:</hi> The other which <hi>Imagineth</hi> or longeth after the Center of the Word, which out of the Anguiſh, as through a dying ſinketh down into the <hi>free Life,</hi> and thus bringeth a Life out of the Anguiſh ſource or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with it ſelf, into the Liberty, ſo that the Eternal Abyſſe becometh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended to be a Life, and out of the Nothing becometh an Eternal Life.</p>
                     <p n="63">63. Seeing then the firſt progreſs or paſſing of the willing climeth up to the fires Birth, therefore we apprehend it to be the <hi>firſt Nature,</hi> viz: the Fathers Nature in the fierce wrathfull anger.</p>
                     <p n="64">64. And the <hi>ſecond entrance</hi> of the willing into the Liberty into the Center of the Heart, we apprehend to be the Divine Nature, to be the Life in the Light in the power of the Deity.</p>
                     <p n="65">65. Thus it is apprehenſible to us, what the <hi>firſt Will</hi> to the fire work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and acteth, <hi>viz:</hi> ſtern or ſtrong, harſh, bitter, and great Anguiſh, which is the <hi>third</hi> Form of Nature.</p>
                     <p n="66">66. For the Anguiſh is at were the Center where the Life and the Will Eternally exiſteth originally; for the Will, willeth to be <hi>free</hi> from the great <hi>Anguiſh</hi> and yet may not; It willeth to flee and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh withheld by the harſhneſſe, and the greater the Will to the fleeing is, the greater is the bitter Sting of the Eſſences and Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
                     <p n="67">67. Seeing then it cannot flee, alſo not clime up aloft, therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh whirling as a <hi>Wheel:</hi> And there the Eſſences become mixed, and the Multiplicity of the Eſſences come into a mixed willing, which is juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the Eternal Minde, where the Multiplicity with the Innumerable Beings or Subſtances, lye, in a Minde, where continually out of one Eſſence may again a Will Exiſt, according to the property of that Eſſence out of which the Eternall Wonders <hi>originally ariſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="78">78. Seeing then the great and ſtrong Minde of the anguiſh form, thus
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61437:15"/> goeth as a wheele in it ſelf, and continually breaketh the ſtrong attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and with the ſting bringeth it into the multiplicity of Eſſences; and yet in the anguiſh again compriſeth it in the Wheele again into ONE, as into a <hi>Minde,</hi> therefore is the Anguiſh life now Generated, <hi>viz.</hi> Nature, where there is a ſtirring, driving fleeing and holding, as alſo a <hi>feeling taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hearing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="69">69. And yet is <hi>not</hi> a right life; but meerly a <hi>Nature-Life,</hi> without a Principle, for it hath no ſprouting or vegetation, but is as a ſenſeleſneſs or Madneſs, where ſomewhat goeth whirling in it ſelf as a Wheele, where indeed there is a <hi>Band</hi> of Life, but without <hi>underſtanding</hi> and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for it knoweth not it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="70">70. Now we are further to ſearch, concerning the <hi>Second</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Eternall Father, which is called GOD, that in the Center of its heart deſireth the Light and the manifeſtation of the Trinity in the Wiſdome.</p>
                     <p n="71">71. That very Will is appointed or ſet oppoſite to the Center of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for out of Nature, muſt the Glance of the <hi>Majeſty</hi> originally Exiſt; and ſo now that very <hi>ſecond Will</hi> in the Word of Life, hath the <hi>Liberty</hi> in it ſelf; and the Anguiſh-will in the ſharpneſs of Nature, deſireth the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, that the Liberty might be manifeſt in the anguiſh of the fierce wrathfull Minde.</p>
                     <p n="72">72. From whence then alſo, the <hi>anguiſh</hi> exiſteth; that the <hi>firſt Will,</hi> willeth to be free from the dark harſhneſs or aſtringency, and the <hi>Liberty</hi> deſireth the Revelation or Manifeſtation; for it cannot find it ſelf in it ſelf, without the ſharpneſs of the ſource or quality; for the Will of the Liberty which is called Father, <hi>deſireth</hi> to Manifeſt it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="73">73.

                     <p n="87">87. The ſecond Subſtance, viz. the <hi>houſe</hi> of the Skreek in it ſelf, in death in the darkneſs of the Enimicitious ſource or quality; which Alſo muſt ſtand; that in that anguiſh, there be an Eternal<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 8.22.</note> 
                        <hi>panting or longing, to be looſed from the</hi> ſource or quality.</p>
                     <p n="88">88. For, that panting or longing maketh the firſt willing to Nature E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally deſirous, to come to help its Subſtance, whence then alſo in the Fathers willing the Mercifulneſs originally ariſeth, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth with the Liberty into the Anguiſh; but cannot continue in the Anguiſh, but goeth in the fire, forth into the <hi>Love ſource</hi> or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                     <p n="89">89. His ſecond willing, <hi>viz:</hi> his heart, goeth forth in him as a well ſpring or fountain of Love and Mercifulneſs, from whence the <hi>Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> hath its original, ſo that there is a pitty upon the Miſery and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity and a fellow-ſuffering or compaſſion; And then the Fathers Will which yet is free, manifeſteth it ſelf in the fierce wrath of Nature, ſo that the fierce wrathfulneſs becometh <hi>meekened.</hi>

                     <p n="90">90. But nevertheleſs, as to one part, the Anxious wheele of the fierce wrath continueth to it ſelf; for in the Skreek a Mortifying is affected; <hi>not</hi> through ſtill death, but a Mortal Life, which is like the <hi>worſt</hi> or baſeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="91">91. And on the other Part, the Life goeth out from Death, and ſo <hi>Death muſt thus</hi> be a cauſe of the Life; Elſe if no ſuch venomous poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fierce wrathful ſource or quality were; the fire could not become generated, and no fire, ſharpneſs, and Eſſence, could be, and then alſo there <hi>would be</hi> no Light, alſo no finding of the Life.</p>
                     <p n="92">92. The <hi>firſt Will,</hi> which is called Father, findeth it ſelf thus in Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and the <hi>ſecond Will,</hi> which is called Sonne, findeth it ſelf thus in Power; Moreover thus alſo the Kingdome of Joy ariſeth; for if there were no Wo, there would be alſo no Kingdome of Joy, But this is the Kingdome of Joy that the Life becometh <hi>releaſed</hi> out of the Anguiſh; though indeed the Life only thus ariſeth.</p>
                     <p n="93">93. <hi>Therefore</hi> the Creatures have poyſon for their Life, <hi>viz:</hi> a Gall; The Gall is a Cauſe that there is a Mobility, ſo that the Life ariſeth; for it cauſeth the fire in the Heart; and the fire is the right Life.</p>
                     <p n="94">94. But it is <hi>not the figure</hi> of the Life, out of the fire life exiſteth the <hi>right Spirit,</hi> which goeth forth from the fire into the light, which is free from the fire: As the Aire, which yet ariſeth from the fire, is free from the fire.</p>

                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61437:17"/>95. For, the <hi>right Spirit,</hi> or the Spirit in Man, which becometh genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the Soules fire, that hath its property in the Light of Life which burneth out from the fire; for it <hi>exiſteth</hi> out of Death, it goeth forth out from the <hi>dying:</hi> The enimicitious ſource or quality, is gone from it and remaining in the fire, and furthermore under the fire in the cauſe of the fire, <hi>viz:</hi> in the fierce wrathful<note n="*" place="margin">Or Anger.</note> Death.</p>
                     <p n="96">96 Thus is the fierce wrathfull Death a Root of Life: And here, O, Men, conſider your Death; <hi>alſo</hi> Chriſts Death, who hath generated us again out of the Dying, through the fire of God; for out of the dying the fire-life becometh generated, that which can go out from the Dying, <hi>that is releaſed</hi> from Death, and the fierce wrathfull ſource.</p>
                     <p n="97">97. That is now its Kingdome of joy, when no fierce wrathful ſource more is in it; it is gone from it, and is remained in the in <hi>dying,</hi> in the dark world.</p>
                     <p n="98">98. And thus the Life out of Death attaineth the Eternal Liberty: <hi>Wherein there is no fear</hi> or terrour more; for in the Life, the terrour or Skreek is broken.</p>
                     <p n="99">99. The right Life is a power of Joy: A Continuall <hi>well-doing,</hi> for there is no ſource quality or pain in it, but only a deſire, which hath all properties of the ſource quality or pain.</p>

                        <hi>The Second Chapter.</hi> Concerning the property of the Principle: What the Principle is, or what they all Three are.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. THat is a Principle, when a Life and Mobility findeth it ſelf where <hi>none</hi> is; the <hi>fire</hi> is a Principle with its Property, and the <hi>Light</hi> is alſo a Principle with its Property: For it becometh generated out of the fire, and yet is <hi>not</hi> of the fires property.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It hath alſo its own Life in it ſelf, but the Fire is <hi>Cauſe</hi> thereof, and the fierce wrathfull anguiſh is a cauſe of <hi>Both,</hi> viz: of the Light and Fire-world.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> the will to the Anguiſh, which cauſeth the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh-Nature; which is called Father; that a Man <hi>cannot ſearch out</hi> or fathom, we ſearch and fathom only this, how it introduceth it ſelf into the <hi>higheſt Perfection</hi> into the Subſtance of the Holy Trinity; and how it manifeſteth it self in Three Principles, and how the Eſſence and the ſource or quality originally exiſteth; what Eſſence is, from which the Life with the Senſes or <hi>Thoughts</hi> originally Exiſt; and the Wonder of all Beings or Subſtances.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Thus we apprehend the Third Principle, viz: the ſource or quality of this world, with the Starres and Elements, to be a creature framed out of the Wonders of the Eternall<note n="†" place="margin">Or Wiſdome.</note> Subſtantiality: <hi>The Third Principle mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth Both the firſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5.<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> Though indeed, <hi>each</hi> of them is manifeſt in it ſelf: Yet nevertheleſs, the Eternal Subſtance, in its wonders, which have become diſcovered in the Wiſdome, would manifeſt it ſelf in ſuch a property: <hi>viz:</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ground of Eternity, according to the fierce <hi>wrathful</hi> and the <hi>Love</hi>-ſource or quality, and hath created all into a Creaturely and figured Subſtance, according to the Eternall Originall; evill and Good.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. As it is before our Eyes, that in this world there is Evill and Good, of which yet <hi>the Devils</hi> are a great cauſe, who in the Creation in their Fall have more vehemently moved the fierce wrathfull <hi>Matrix</hi> in the fierce wrath.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. In which, God, according to the property of the fierce <hi>wrath,</hi> hath moved yet more exceedingly, to thruſt them forth out of the Light into
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61437:18"/> the Death of the fierce wrathfulneſs: Whence alſo the Heavenly Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality <hi>became together</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Or kindled by the Pride of the Devill.</note> Moved, ſo that very much, is become ſhut up, together in the Earthly Subſtantiality, that hath ſtood free in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. As we apprehend by the Gold and its <hi>Tincture,</hi> which is free from the Earthly Subſtance; for it ſubſiſteth in the Fire, and in all ſources qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities or conditions, no ſource or quality <hi>can overpower it,</hi> but only Gods Will; and ſomewhat muſt often be done, for the ſake of the worlds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And when we rightly conſider, the Creating of this World, and <hi>the Spirit</hi> of the Third Principle; <hi>viz:</hi> take before us the Spirit of the Great World with the Starres and Elements; then we find the Eternall Worlds property, and as it were mixed, as a great Wonder, <hi>whereby</hi> God the higheſt Good would manifeſt the Eternall Wonders which ſtand in ſecret, and bring them into ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. We find Evill and Good, and we find in all things the <hi>Center of Nature,</hi> viz: the Anguiſh Chamber: eſpecially we find the Spirit of the Great World in two Sources or Qualities, in Heat and Cold: By the <hi>Cold</hi> we apprehend the Center of the harſh ſharp fierce wrath; by the <hi>Heat,</hi> the Principle in the fire; yet they have but <hi>One</hi> originall out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The Fire cometh out of the fierce wrath of the Cold: The Cold out of the Center of Nature; out of the harſh aſtringent ſharp anguiſh, where the <hi>harſh aſtringency</hi> draweth ſo very ſtrongly in it ſelf, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Subſtantiality.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. As is to be apprehended: That in the Moving of the Father, in the Creation, <hi>it hath made</hi> Earth and Stones, whereas there was no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or Matter for it, but only its own Subſtance, which, in both the Principles, <hi>viz:</hi> in the Light World, and in the Deaths World, in <hi>both</hi> the Deſires, was become Generated.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. That which in the Moving attained the fierce wrath, that was <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi> Created for the Globe of the Earth; and <hi>therefore</hi> Men find there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Many ſorts of Evill and of Good.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. And it cometh often to paſſe, that Man can out of the Worſt of all, make that which is Beſt; <hi>while</hi> the Center of Nature <hi>is therein;</hi> if a Man bring it into the fire; the pure child of the <hi>Eternal Subſtantiality,</hi> may be brought out of it; when it becometh free from death; as is to be ſeen in Gold.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Though indeed in this World we cannot reach to attain the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall fire; and <hi>therefore alſo</hi> we can bring forth nothing out of this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, out of defect, wanting the Eternall fire, which we cannot attain but only <hi>in the Imagination,</hi> through which a Man hath might and power, to bring the Life out of Death; and to bring it into <hi>divine</hi> Subſtantiality; which can be done only in Man, that which is without or beyond Man, belongeth to God: and remaineth to the Renovation in the End of this Time.</p>

                        <hi>Now You are to underſtand, the Subſtance, and the Propertie, of the Principles: Thus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="16">16. THe firſt Principle ſtandeth in the fire of the willing, and is the Cauſe of both the other, alſo of the life and <hi>underſtanding,</hi> and a preſervation of Nature; as alſo of all Properties of the Father.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The Second Principle, ſtandeth in the Light: <hi>viz:</hi> in the Fire of the deſire; this deſire maketh <hi>Subſtance,</hi> out of the Property of the firſt Principle.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. The Firſt and Second Principle is Father and Sonne; in the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: One dwelleth in the other, and yet <hi>retaineth its property;</hi> there is no mixture in the Eſſence, only the one conceiveth the other in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and the Light <hi>dwelleth</hi> in the <hi>deſire</hi> of the Fire, ſo that the Fires property giveth its deſire into the Light, and the Light into the Fire.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Thus, it is one Subſtance, not two, but <hi>two Properties,</hi> whereof the one is not the other; nor can be, Eternally.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. As the Spirits Property <hi>cannot</hi> be the Fire and Light, and yet goeth forth from the Fire out of the Light; and could not ſubſiſt alone either from the Fire or from the Light ſingly: The Fire could not alone give it, alſo not the Light, but <hi>both</hi> give it. It is the Life of Both, and all this is but one Subſtance or being; but <hi>Three</hi> Properties, whereof one is not the other, as is to be ſeen in Fire Light and Air.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. The Third Principle hath juſt thoſe Properties, it hath alſo Fire, Light, and Spirit, that is, Air, and is <hi>as to all Circumſtances,</hi> like the Eternal Subſtance.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. Yet beginneth, and goeth forth from the Eternity, it is a Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Eternall, an awakening of the Eternall, an Image, and <hi>Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> of the Eternall.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. It is not the Eternall, but <hi>is become</hi> a Subſtance in the Eternall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; the Deſire hath manifeſted it ſelf and brought it ſelf into a Subſtance like the Eternall.</p>

                        <hi>Objection.</hi>
                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed there was no Subſtance or Matter for it, that was <hi>outwardly</hi> pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable; but there was ſuch a Form or Condition, in the Eternal Power in the willing.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. The Creation of this World is effected by or with <hi>an awakening</hi> of the Spirit of the willing, the inward Will which alſo ſtandeth within, in it ſelf, that hath ſtirred up its own Nature, <hi>viz:</hi> the <hi>Center,</hi> which is deſirous of that which is out of it ſelf, <hi>viz:</hi> of the Light, which is preſſing forth out of the <hi>Center.</hi>

Thus hath the <hi>Center,</hi> out of it ſelf, compriſed a Subſtance in the deſiring, that is, it hath compriſed or made to it ſelf a Subſtance in its Imagination <hi>in the deſire,</hi> and hath together alſo comprehended the Lights being or ſubſtance: It hath comprehended the Eternall, with the begin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. <hi>Therefore,</hi> muſt the Subſtance in this world, together with the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, goe again into the Eternall, for they are in the Eternall together <hi>compriſed</hi> or Comprehended.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. But whatſoever became made or compriſed out of the beginning in the deſire, <hi>that goeth again</hi> into its Aether; <hi>viz:</hi> into the Nothing, only and barely into the Looking-glaſſe of the Imagination, again: And is not of or from the Eternall; but is, and belongeth to, the Eternall <hi>Magia,</hi> in the deſiring: As a fire devoureth and conſumeth a Subſtance whereof nothing remaineth, but it <hi>becometh again</hi> that which it was, when it was yet no Subſtance.</p>
                     <p n="29">29. Thus you are to underſtand what this Worlds Subſtance is: <hi>Viz:</hi> a <hi>Coagulated</hi> Vapour or Cloud out of the Eternall Aether; which thus hath a Completion or product <hi>like</hi> the Eternall.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. It ſhuts it ſelf up into a Center of a Subſtance and in the <hi>End</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth it ſelf again, and goeth into the Eternall <hi>Magia,</hi> and is but <hi>for a while,</hi> a Wonder, <hi>viz:</hi> a Manifeſtation or Revelation of the Eternall, whereby, the Eternall, which is manifeſt in it ſelf, alſo manifeſteth it ſelf out of it ſelf; and <hi>ſheddeth forth</hi> its Imagination; and thus reneweth whatſoever with the Moving in the deſiring became comprehended or Made; that <hi>ſo</hi> the End <hi>could go again</hi> into the beginning.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. For, Nothing can enter into the Liberty of the Eternall, unleſſe it be <hi>like</hi> the Eternall, and ſubſiſteth in the Will-Fire, and be as ſubtile as the Lights Subſtantiality, that is, as a Fire, which can dwell in a Subſtance, wherein the Light can dwell, and <hi>bring its ſhining Luſter</hi> forth through it; that doth not become comprehended by the Center of Nature, though indeed it be the property of Nature: Yet it is an Eternall one.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. Therefore, underſtand, that all, whatſoever hath become generated in this world, <hi>which hath a Subſtance,</hi> which hath ſprung forth out of the Eternall Subſtance, that inheriteth <hi>not</hi> the Eternall, only its <hi>Figure</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a Magicall manner, ſtanding in the Eternall Myſtery: For it is in the originall, together with the Creation, gone forth out of the Eternall.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. But its <hi>body,</hi> and totall Subſtance of the ſource or quality, <hi>paſſeth away,</hi> as a Vapour or Cloud conſumeth it ſelf; for it is out of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and goeth into the End.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. But that which ariſeth out of the Eternall Subſtance, out of the Eternall Lights Subſtantiality; <hi>cannot paſſe away;</hi> that only of it paſſeth away, which out of the beginning is entered into the Eternall; viz: <hi>the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Fleſh,</hi> which through the Imagination, was in Man, introduced, into the Eternall; that muſt conſume it ſelf as a Vapour.</p>

                     <p n="36">36. But whatſoever becometh generated out of the Eternall Center of the fierce wrath, that <hi>may enter into</hi> its Renovation if it will.</p>
                     <p n="37">37. As, the Eternall Nature of the Subſtance of this World <hi>reneweth</hi> it ſelf, and leaveth or forſaketh whatſoever it had made in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and reteineth only the Magicall Image, which it introduced out of the Eternall willing into the outward, with the Word <hi>Fiat,</hi> in the Creating: <hi>So may Man</hi> alſo renew whatſoever he Maketh; if he forſake the Earthly, then he may renew whatſoever he hath generated out of the Eternall; but if it be <hi>not</hi> renewed, then it remaineth in the Source or Quality, of the Torment.</p>
                     <p n="38">38. For, all whatſoever <hi>doth not become,</hi> or <hi>is not</hi> alike, to or with the<note n="*" place="margin">Love-fire.</note> Fire Light and Water, cannot ſubſiſt in the Liberty, but remaineth in the ſource or <hi>painfull</hi> quality of that which it hath awakened or made in it ſelf, underſtand, out of the <hi>Center</hi> of Nature, whatſoever it hath intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the willing of the Liberty.</p>
                     <p n="39">39. Thus will that be to it a painfull ſource or quality and a <hi>Gnawing</hi> or oppoſite will, which it ſelf hath generated to it ſelf out of its own Nature; wherewith it hath made to it ſelf, the Liberty to be <hi>dark,</hi> ſo that the Light cannot ſhine through, and that becometh its Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p n="40">40. For, where the Will is dark, there alſo is the Subſtance of the willing, <hi>viz:</hi> its Body, <hi>dark,</hi> and where the Will is in a <hi>pure</hi> ſource or quality, there alſo is the body in that ſource or quality: And <hi>for that cauſe,</hi> the children of the Light, and of the Liberty, will be ſevered from the children of the Darkneſs in the Anxious ſource or quality, each into its Principle.</p>
                     <p n="41">41. Furthermore, each Principle generateth its <hi>own</hi> Life, according to its Property; <hi>viz:</hi> the fire is the limit of Seperation, which<note n="†" place="margin">Vergnug et.</note> 
                        <hi>ſatiateth the Two Eternall Principles,</hi> viz: the Dark and Light World; to the Darkneſs it giveth its ſting and the woe; and to the Light, its perceptibility and Life.</p>
                     <p n="42">42. Thus alſo, hath the Third Principle, two properties, <hi>viz:</hi> Heat and Cold, the Heat <hi>is the Principle,</hi> and giveth its ſting and woe to the Cold, to the Light it giveth the Life and perceptibility: The Light again gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth its <hi>ſubſtance</hi> to the fire, ſo that it becometh friendly united there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
                     <p n="43">43. The Cold giveth alſo its property and ſubſtance to the fire, and the fire breaketh it to pieces, and maketh out of the Subſtance thereof, the Death and <hi>a dying;</hi> and <hi>therefore</hi> there is an Enmity between Heat and Cold, and they never become one.</p>
                     <p n="44">
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:61437:20"/>44. But this they attain in their Enmity; that to them <hi>the Life ſprout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> through death; for out of Heat and Cold cometh the Sprout of the Third Principle, <hi>wherein</hi> we live <hi>outwardly;</hi> out of the Cold cometh fruit out of the Earth, as alſo the Body of all Creatures, and in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Subſtance.</p>
                     <p n="45">45. From the Heat in its contention, <hi>cometh the Life</hi> in the Body of all Creatures and Vegetables; as alſo in the Deep of the Elements, it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Spirit of the Great World in Many <hi>varieties</hi> of Figures; and where the Cold maketh ſubſtance, there the Heat maketh a Spirit therein.</p>
                     <p n="46">46. Thus is the Subſtance alwayes in the wreſtling, that the Wonders of the Eternall World, may become <hi>manifeſted</hi> in the fragility or Tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torineſs: And that the Eternall Modell in the Wiſdome of God, may bring it ſelf into figures, and that the ſame Modell, in the Eternall <hi>Magia,</hi> may ſtand Eternally to Gods<note n="*" place="margin">Or Works of Wonder.</note> Wonders in the <hi>Myſtery;</hi> and to the Ioy of Angels and Men.</p>
                     <p n="47">47. Indeed not in the Subſtance, but in the Myſterie, in the <hi>Magia,</hi> like a ShaddoW of the Subſtance; that it might <hi>Eternally</hi> be apprehended or known, what God hath wrought, and what he can and is able to doe.</p>
                     <p n="48">48.<note n="†" place="margin">Note.</note> For, after the Breaking of this World, there remaineth only the Eternall in the Subſtance; <hi>viz:</hi> Eternall Spirits with the Eternall <hi>Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality</hi> of their Bodies, together with the here made Wonders, which in the figure ſtand Magically, in which the Spirits <hi>ſhall apprehend</hi> Gods deeds of Wonder and Mighty power.</p>
                     <p n="49">49. The Principles with their Wonders are thus to be conceived or conſidered, <hi>Viz:</hi> they <hi>all Three</hi> are no other then the One only God in his deeds of wonder, who hath according to the property of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture manifeſted himſelf with or by this World; and thus we are to underſtand a <hi>Threefold</hi> Subſtance, <hi>viz:</hi> Three Worlds one in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p n="50">50.<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> One the <hi>Firſt</hi> is the <hi>fire-world,</hi> which ariſeth from the Center of Nature, and Nature from the deſirous willing, which in the Eternall Liberty ariſeth in the Abyſſe, <hi>of which we have</hi> no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                     <p n="51">51. The other the <hi>Second</hi> is the <hi>Light World,</hi> which dwelleth in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in the Abyſſe without or beyond Nature, but proceedeth forth from the <hi>fire world;</hi> it conceiveth its Life and perceptibility from the fire; it <hi>dwelleth</hi> in the fire, and the fire comprehendeth it not, and that is the Middle-world.</p>
                     <p n="52">52. The fire giveth in the Center of Nature, for its Kindling, the Dark world; but is in its Kindling <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> the Light-world, where it ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf into the Light; and letteth the Center be in the Darkneſs; for it is only a ſource in it ſelf, and a <hi>cauſe</hi> of the Life.</p>

                     <p n="54">54. But the fallen Devils who in the Principle were created in the Light-world, <hi>to them the Darkneſs</hi> is a Pain, and the Fire a Might or Strength and force, for it is their right Life, though indeed according to the ability of the Multitude of Properties of the <hi>Center</hi> of Nature, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Eſſence thereof.</p>
                     <p n="55">55. The <hi>Third</hi> World is the outward, wherein we dwell according to the outward body, together with the <hi>outward Works and Subſtance,</hi> which have been Created out of the Dark and Light-world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is evill and fierce wrathfull, alſo good and Lovely or ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                     <p n="56">56. Of this property <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould not Eat, nor Imagine<note n="†" place="margin">Or according to it.</note>

                     <p n="57">57. For <hi>Adam</hi> was created out of all the Three Worlds, a totall <hi>entire Image,</hi> and Similitude of God; but ſeeing he did eat of Evill and Good, and brought the outward into the Middle, Now muſt the outward break off from the Middle, and that is done in the <hi>ſeparation,</hi> where the outward, muſt go again into its Aether, and the Middlemoſt continueth ſtanding.</p>
                     <p n="58">58. Thus now if any ſee a right Man ſtanding, he may ſay, here I ſee Three Worlds <hi>ſtand,</hi> but <hi>Not go,</hi> for the outward World moveth it ſelf with or by the outward Body: But yet the outward Body hath <hi>no Might</hi> or power to move or ſtirre the Light-world.</p>
                     <p n="50">50. It hath only ſo introduced it ſelf into the Light World, from whence, the<note n="*" place="margin">The Light world.</note> ſame is become <hi>extinguiſhed</hi> in Man; and, it ſelf not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding is remained to be only the Dark world in it ſelf: And the Light world to ſtand <hi>unmoveable</hi> in it: That ſtandeth in it as it were hidden.</p>
                     <p n="60">60. But, if he be a right Man out of the <hi>New birth,</hi> then it ſtandeth in him, as the Light ſhineth through the water, and maketh it moveable and <hi>deſirous</hi> of the Eſſence, ſo that the Eſſence ſprouteth: ſo alſo doth the New-Man in the Light.</p>

                     <p n="65">65.<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note>This, <hi>Phur,</hi> is the Chiefeſt cauſe to Life and to the Subſtance of all things, <hi>though indeed</hi> it be evill in it ſelf, yet it is to the Life, and to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the Life, the <hi>moſt profitable</hi> of all.</p>

                        <hi>The Third Chapter.</hi> Concerning the <hi>Mixed</hi> Tree of Evill and Good; or concerning the Life of the Three Principles one in another; how that <hi>uniteth</hi> it ſelf and accordeth.</head>
                     <p n="1">1.<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> IN Gods Kingdome, <hi>viz:</hi> in the Light World, there is no More, but one Principle <hi>rightly known:</hi> For, the light hath the Dominion; and the other ſources or qualities and properties, are all ſecret as a <hi>Myſterie,</hi> for they muſt all <hi>ſerve</hi> the Light, and give their willing up into the Light, and therefore the fierce wrathfull Eſſence in the Light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh <hi>changed</hi> into a Deſire of Light and of Love in Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Though indeed the properties, <hi>viz:</hi> harſh, bitter, Anguiſh, and the bitter woe in the Fire, <hi>continue</hi> Eternally <hi>even in</hi> the Light World, yet none of them is manifeſt in its property; but they are all of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only thus a Cauſe of the Life, of the Mobility and Joy.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That which in the Dark World is a woe, that is in the Light World a well-doing Munificence; and <hi>that</hi> which in the Dark is a ſtinging and hating enmity, <hi>that</hi> is in the Light a riſing leaping Joy; And <hi>that</hi> which in the Dark is a Fear Terrour and Trembling, <hi>that</hi> is in the Light an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulting and Triumphing of Joy, a ringing forth and ſinging: And <hi>that could not be,</hi> if in the Originall there were not ſuch an Earneſt Eager ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere ſource or quality.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Therefore</hi> is the Dark World, the Light Worlds ground and originall, and the <hi>anxious Evill</hi> muſt be an Originall of the Good, and <hi>is all Gods;</hi> yet the<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> Light World is only called God.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And the Principle between the Light World and the Dark World, is called <hi>Gods anger</hi> and fierce wrath: And, if that <hi>be awakened</hi> (as by the Devill, and all evill or wicked men it is) they then become for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of the Light and fall into the Dark World.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The <hi>Dark World</hi> is called Death, Hell, the Abyſſe, and a Sting of Death, Deſpair, Self-enmity, and Lamentation; a life of Malice, Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and Falſhood: in which the Truth and the Light is denied and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61437:23"/> not apprehended or <hi>diſcerned,</hi> wherein the Devils dwell and the Damned Souls; alſo the helliſh Wormes, which the Deaths <hi>Fiat,</hi> in the moving of the All-ſubſtantial Lord, hath <hi>figured.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. For, Hell hath in the Darkneſſe, the Greateſt Conſtellation of the Moſt Severe eager Power, in that all is Loud ſounding as a Great Noiſe; that which ringeth in the Light, that knocketh rumbleth or <hi>Thumpeth</hi> in the dark, as is to be apprehended in thoſe things that Men uſe to ſtrike upon, that they give a ringing ſound; for the ringing is not the Subſtance; as a Bell which men ring-out, that is it ſelf no Sound, but only a hardneſs, and a <hi>cauſe</hi> of the ringing ſound.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Bell conceiveth or receiveth the <hi>ſtroke,</hi> viz: the knocking, and from the hard knocking the ringing ſound goeth forth; the cauſe is this; that there is in the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Bell a Subſtance, that together in the Creation, in the Moving of the All-being or All-ſubſtantiall God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>ſhut up</hi> in the hardneſs; as is to be perceived by us in the Metalline <hi>Tincture,</hi> if men would not be ſo mad and blind.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Thus, we apprehend, that in Hell in the Abyſſe, there are many and <hi>ſundry ſorts of Spirits,</hi> not Devils only but many Helliſh Wormes, according to their Conſtellation and property, not,<note n="*" place="margin">Or having.</note> with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; As in this World, there are unreaſonable Beaſts, Toads, and Serpents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. For, all would be Creaturely, and is gone into a Subſtance, ſo that thus the Anger-Looking-Glaſs alſo <hi>ſheweth its</hi> Wonders <hi>and</hi> manifeſteth it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Indeed there is no perception of <hi>woe</hi> in the Helliſh Wormes, for they are of the ſame Eſſence and property; it is their Life, and is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; which ſtandeth hidden to the outward World, only the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God</hi> which in all the Three Principles is it ſelf the ſource or quality according to the property of each of them; he knoweth it, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſteth it <hi>to whom</hi> he will.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Now then if we will ſay, how the Principles unite in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; then we muſt ſet the fire, <hi>viz:</hi> the higheſt ſtrength in the <hi>Middle,</hi> that giveth to each Principle a well-pleaſing Life, and a Spirit which it deſireth.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Therefore there is no ſtrife in the Principles, for the fire is the Life of all Principles, that is <hi>the cauſe</hi> of the Life, <hi>not</hi> the Life it <hi>Self.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. To the Abyſſe it giveth its <hi>woe, viz:</hi> the ſting, ſo that Death findeth it ſelf in a Life, elſe the Abyſs were a ſtill <hi>vacuum:</hi> It giveth its fierce wrath to it, ſo that out of the Abyſſes Life, mobility ariſeth, elſe it were a ſtill void Eternity and a Nothing.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. And to the Light World the Fire giveth alſo its Eſſence, elſe there would be no <hi>perception</hi> or Light therein, and all were but ONE, yet without the fire, a Nothing, <hi>viz:</hi> an<note n="*" place="margin">A Vge.</note> Eye of Wonders, which apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> it ſelf, wherein there were no underſtanding, but an Eternall <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> or hiddenneſs, where <hi>no</hi> ſeeking or production <hi>could</hi> be.</p>
                     <p n="16">
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61437:23"/>16. To the Third Principle, <hi>viz:</hi> to the Kingdome of this World the fire giveth alſo its Eſſence and ſource or quality, whence all and every Life and Subſtance becometh <hi>ſtirring,</hi> all perception or ſenſibility or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitability, and whatſoever ſhall come to be Somewhat, <hi>muſt</hi> have Fire; there ſpringeth nothing out of the Earth without the fires Eſſence: <hi>It is a cauſe</hi> of all the Three Principles, and all whatſoever can be named.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. Thus, the fire maketh an union of all the Three Principles, and is in <hi>Each of them</hi> the cauſe of the Subſtance; no Principle ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth againſt the other, but the Eſſence of each deſireth only its own, and is alwayes in ſtrife; <hi>if that were not,</hi> all would be a ſtill void Nothing: Each Principle giveth to the other its power and form or condition, and there is a Continuall League or Peace between them.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. The Dark World hath the Great pain and Anguiſh, which the fire cauſeth, ſo that the Will panteth or longeth after the Liberty, and the Liberty panteth after the<note n="†" place="margin">Note.</note> Manifeſtation, <hi>viz:</hi> after the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and giveth it ſelf into the fierce wrath, that it might manifeſt it ſelf; and ſo bringeth it ſelf into Fire, ſo that out of the fierce wrath and the Liberty, <hi>a fire ariſeth,</hi> and ſo giveth it ſelf, to the fierce wrath, to be devoured, <hi>viz:</hi> into Death; but goeth out of the Death with the <hi>aſſumed</hi> Eſſences forth into its own, <hi>viz:</hi> into a World and ſource or quality of its own, and dwelleth in it ſelf, unapprehended by Death and the Dark World, and is a Light in it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Thus is Death and the fierce wrath a Mother of the Fire alſo a cauſe of the Light-world, moreover a cauſe of all Subſtances of the Third Principle: A Cauſe of all Eſſences in all and every Life: <hi>How will then</hi> one Principle ſtrive againſt the other? Seeing continually the one vehemently <hi>deſireth</hi> the other.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. For, the Angelicall Light-world, and this outward viſible World, muſt have the Dark Deaths Eſſence, to its life or ſource and quality; It is a continuall <hi>hunger</hi> after it.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. Only this is it: Each Principle maketh the ſource according to <hi>its own</hi> property, it giveth to the Evill its good, and uniteth it ſelf therewith; and maketh of Three, one: So that there is no ſtrife or repugnancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Principles: But in the <hi>Eſſence</hi> is the ſtrife; that muſt be, elſe all would be a Nothing.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. Only we are to conſider; whence Enmity ariſeth. God hath Created in <hi>each</hi> Principle Creatures out of the ſubſtance and <hi>property</hi> of the Principle, therein to continue, if they continue not therein, but lead or introduce another through their Imagination into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into their property, then that is an Enmity and pain.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. As the Devill and fallen Man, who are both of them gone out of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61437:24"/> the Light-world: The Devill into the <hi>Abyſſe</hi> of the ſtrong fierce wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Might or power; of or out of Pride: and Men into this World into the <hi>Myſterie</hi> of Much Skill and Knowledge, <hi>viz:</hi> into the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. Now Man hath neceſſity and ſtrife, that he might goe out again, and <hi>this World</hi> into which he is gone, holdeth him, for it will have him, and if he goeth out with might at any time, it becometh <hi>enraged</hi> with him, aſſaulteth him, and will not ſuffer him in it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. <hi>Hence it cometh,</hi> that the Children of this World, hate and are at enmity, doe plague vex worry beat, kill, and drive the Children of Light from them, for the Spirit of this World, <hi>driveth them</hi> to it: To which alſo the Devill helpeth, for <hi>he knoweth,</hi> that this World ſtandeth upon the Abyſſe, and that he ſhall get the Children of this World in the breaking of this Myſtery into his Kingdome: And therefore he baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or driveth the Children of God, from the Children of this World, that they <hi>bring not</hi> the Children of this world alſo along with them into the Light-world.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. But, if Man had been created to this World, <hi>he</hi> would let him well be at peace; but he would fain continually poſſeſs his Royall Seat, which he had, and was thruſt out from it, and though he may by no meanes attain it, yet he <hi>cannot afford</hi> that to the Children that ſhould poſſeſs it.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. This is therefore now highly to be conſidered by Man and not to be ſo blind, that though indeed Man is Entered into the Myſtery of this World, he ſhould not ſo eagerly as a priſoner, even enter into the <hi>Earthly ſeeking</hi> or Malady of the Shutting up of Death; but ſhould be an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehender and Skilfull Knower of the Myſtery, and not the Devils Owle and Fool: And ſhould with the <hi>Imagination</hi> conſtantly goe forth again into the Light-world, to which he was Created: That the Light might give him its Glance or Luſtre, that he might know himſelf, and ſee the outward Myſterie; and <hi>then</hi> he is a Man.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. But if Not; then he is a Fool, and an Ape or Mimick of the Light-world, as an Ape will be <hi>Wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="29">29. His Juggling tricks with the Light-world, when he preſſeth not thereinto with Earneſtneſs, but <hi>playeth only</hi> therewith; that the Devill derides, and holdeth him for a Fool: And ſo he is: He is a Beaſt-Man; ſo long as with his willing he <hi>hangeth</hi> to the outward, and accounteth this Worlds good for his <hi>Treaſure:</hi> He is but a Man with this Worlds Subſtance, and not with the Subſtance of the divine Light world; and he giveth his <hi>Body</hi> to this World, that is, to the Earth; and his <hi>Soul</hi> to the Abyſſe of the Dark-world.</p>

Thus underſtand, The Tree of the three Principles, agreeth very well, one in another, but the <hi>Creatures Not,</hi> for the Creatures of Each Principle deſire <hi>not</hi> thoſe of the other, and therefore alſo there is a <hi>faſt Sluce</hi> or<note n="*" place="margin">Lock Barre, Cliffe, or Gulf.</note> incloſure between them, ſo that one <hi>cannot</hi> nor ſhall not ſee the other.</p>

                        <hi>The Fourth Chapter.</hi> Of the Originall of <hi>Contrariety</hi> in the Sprout or Vegetation, in that the Life is Striving in it Self.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. A Thing that is ONE, that hath only One willing, it ſtriveth not againſt it ſelf: But where there are many willings in one thing, there they are ſtriving, for every one will goe <hi>its</hi> conceived and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended Way.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But if one be Lord of the other, ſo that it hath <hi>full power</hi> over the other, ſo that it can break it, or ſubdue it when it will not be obedient, there the Multiplicity of a Thing, ſubſiſteth in <hi>one Subſtance,</hi> for the Multiplicity of the willing, giveth it ſelf altogether in obedience to its Lord.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thus alſo it is in the Contrariety of the Life: For, the Life ſtandeth in Many willings, <hi>every Eſſence</hi> may produce a willing, and doth produce it alſo; For Harſh Aſtringency, Bitter, Anguiſh and Soureneſs, are <hi>each</hi> of them Contrary Sources; each of which hath its property, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether contrary againſt one another.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Alſo the Fire is an Enemy to all the <hi>other,</hi> for it ſetteth every Source in great anguiſh, ſo that there is great Contrariety between them, the one alwayes being at <hi>Enmity</hi> with the other; <hi>as is to be ſeen</hi> in Heat and Cold, alſo in Water and Fire, in Life and Death.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In like manner, the Life of Man is at Enmity with it Self: One form of <hi>diſpoſition</hi> is at Enmity with the other in all Creatures; <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe</hi> that the form or Condition of the Life get a Meek amiable Lord, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe ſubjection it muſt be, which can break its authority and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That is the Light of Life, that is the Lord of all Formes or Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, it can <hi>ſubdue</hi> them all, they muſt all give up their willing to the Light and they do it alſo <hi>readily,</hi> for the Light giveth them meekneſſe and power, ſo that its ſtern harſh bitter anxious form, becometh alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>charged</hi> into amiableneſs, they give up their Willings alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the Light of Life; and the Light giveth them Meekneſs.</p>

                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:61437:25"/>7. Thus the Multiplicity becometh changed into one, into One wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and that is called the Mind, and is the Well-ſpring where the one only will <hi>can create</hi> out of it, Evill and Good; which is done through Imagination, or through <hi>Repreſentation</hi> of a Thing, that is Evill, or Good: And ſo is the property of that Thing, capable of the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in the Life.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Lifes property catcheth or receiveth the <hi>property</hi> of the Thing Repreſented, be it either a Word or a Work, and kindleth it ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with in it ſelf: And alſo the other formes of the Life therewith; ſo that they begin to qualifie or operate, and every property <hi>burneth</hi> in its ſource or quality, to Love or Anger, all according to the <hi>Repreſented</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; whatſoever the Imagination caught or captivated, that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduceth into the Mind.</p>
                     <p n="9">9.

                     <p n="16">16. Thus alſo it is to be underſtood concerning the outward World; Gods Light ſhineth through and through, but is <hi>only</hi> comprehended <hi>by that</hi> which doth unite and appropriate it ſelf thereunto.</p>

                        <hi>The Sixt Chapter.</hi> How the Inward is Manifeſted in the Outward: Of the Three Worlds: <hi>In what Manner,</hi> God dwelleth in all Things or Subſtances: How the whole World <hi>might be</hi> a Meer Sun: What, Man is: And wherein God behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Himſelf.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. If we would Conſider all this, and goe out of the Inward Worlds, into the Outward, into this viſible World: Then we ſhould find, that the <hi>Subſtance of the outward</hi> World is proceeded out of the Inward; <hi>viz: out of the</hi> Imagination or deſiring of the Inward Worlds; and that in the outward World are found the properties of both the Inward Worlds.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Alſo we find that the Will of both the Properties are ſtirring and manifeſt in the outward World: And then how the Good, <hi>viz:</hi> the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which is proceeded out of the Light-world, is totally <hi>ſhut up</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Anger and Death; And how the Divine Power maketh all ſtirring, ſo that all groweth forth, out of and through, the fierce wrath of Death.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For, the Earthly <hi>Tincture,</hi> hath no Communion, with the heavenly in the Light-world; yet we find another <hi>Tincture</hi> in the Earth, which hath Communion with the Heavenly; <hi>viz:</hi> in the Pretious Coſtly Metals: And yet is together ſhut up.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And underſtand the Moving and the <hi>Fiat</hi> of both the Eternall Worlds, thus, The Dark and Light-world, have each of them Longed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Subſtance; and where God once moveth Himſelf, the one World without the other could not be moved.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. For, the Dark-world holdeth or hath in it, the <hi>firſt Center,</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Light-world, the <hi>ſecond Center, viz:</hi> the Heart of God, or the Word of the Power of the Deity; and the one World is not ſevered from the other.</p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:61437:30"/>6. Whereby it is to be apprehended, in what danger we ſtand: And ought to be conſidered, <hi>whither</hi> we will caſt or incline our willing; for if we caſt our ſelves into the Earthly Seeking, then it captivateth us: And then the Source or Quality of the Abyſſe is our Lord, and the Sun our temporall God.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. But if we caſt or incline our ſelves with our willing, into the World without or <hi>beyond</hi> this World; then the Light World catcheth hold of our willing, and God becometh our Lord; and we leave the Earthly Life to this World; and take along with us what is come into us, <hi>viz:</hi> into Adam: <hi>Out of the Light-world,</hi> that together with the willing which becometh<note n="*" place="margin">Or one and the ſame.</note> one Spirit with God, is brought forth out of this World.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Reaſon ſaith: Where are then the Three Worlds; It would needs ſtreight have a ſeparation of them aſunder, <hi>as if</hi> one were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or diſtant from the Other, or ſtood above the other; which yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be: Elſe the Eternall <hi>Abyſſall Subſtance</hi> muſt never it ſelf aſunder.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. But <hi>how</hi> can that ſever it ſelf aſunder, which is in Nothing? which hath no place? <hi>which it ſelf is All?</hi> Moſt certainly that cannot come into particular or partition which hath no Ground; that ſuffereth not it ſelf to be conceived, which dwelleth in it ſelf; and poſſeſſeth it ſelf: Yet it goeth out from it ſelf, and <hi>Manifeſteth</hi> it ſelf out of it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. It maketh a thing out of it ſelf, which in it ſelf is but a Will, in it ſelf it is a Spirit, but it maketh out of it ſelf a <hi>Form</hi> of a Spirit; and the Form Maketh a Subſtance, according to the property of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: Even as this World is a Subſtance and the Inward Spirit poſſeſſeth the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. It is in all places, yet the <hi>place</hi> comprehendeth it Not, but it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth the Place, the Place knoweth Nothing of it, yet <hi>feeleth</hi> it; it is the Power and the Spirit in the Place, its Will goeth through the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and the Subſtance hath <hi>no</hi> Eyes to ſee <hi>it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. But it is, the ſeeing, of the Place, and is it ſelf no Place, or Space, but maketh to it ſelf an Abyſſall Space where there is no meaſure or circumſcription; it is all, yet like to a Nothing; <hi>compared</hi> with the outward; what it giveth forth out of it ſelf, that alſo it poſſeſſeth: It doth not enter into it, but is there BEFORE-HAND; <hi>before</hi> the Subſtance receiveth the Place in.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The Place comprehendeth but a Glance of its willing; as one ſeeth his form in a Looking-Glaſſe, but doth not comprehend it or lay hold of it: Or as the Sun-ſhine in the Water <hi>is not comprehended;</hi> yet the Water feeleth it, and conceiveth or receiveth the Glance or Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or as the Earth conceiveth or receiveth Power from the Sun, ſo that it bringeth forth Fruit: <hi>Thus</hi> God dwelleth in all Things or Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and preſſeth through all, and <hi>yet</hi> is comprehended by Nothing.</p>
                     <p n="14">
                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:61437:31"/>14. And as we underſtand, that the Earth hath a great hunger and <hi>deſire</hi> after the Suns Power and Light, in which it attracteth the Suns Power and light to it ſelf; and is capable thereof; which without the deſiring could not be: In like manner the Outward Subſtance hungereth after the Inward; for the Outward <hi>Form ariſeth</hi> from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Thus the outward Subſtance conceiveth or receiveth, the Inward Form into it ſelf, as a Glance or Power: <hi>For</hi> the Inward Spirit, cannot receive the outward Subſtance, for it dwelleth not in the outward; but poſſeſſeth <hi>it ſelf in it ſelf</hi> in the Inward; yet the Spirits Form together with the Looking-Glaſſe, receiveth the outward Subſtance; as the Water doth the Glance or Luſtre of the Sun.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. But we are <hi>not to think,</hi> that the Inward is farre from the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as the body of the Sun, from the Water; though indeed that is not ſo neither, the Sun is not farre from the Water; For the Water <hi>hath</hi> the Suns <hi>property</hi> and Subſtance; elſe the Water would not catch the Sun's Glance or Luſtre; though really the Sun is a <hi>Corpus</hi> or Body, yet the Sun is alſo in the Water, but not Manifeſted: The <hi>Corpus</hi> or Body maketh the Sun Manifeſt in the Water.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. And we are to know, that this World would be a meer Sun, and the place of the Sun would be <hi>every where,</hi> if God would but kindle and Manifeſt, it; for Every Subſtance in this World receiveth the Glance of the Sun, there is in <hi>all</hi> a Looking-Glaſſe, ſo that it may receive the power and form of the Sun, in all animate and inanimate things in all the four Elements, and their Eſſence and Subſtance.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. <hi>Thus</hi> in like manner, it hath alſo ſuch a form in the Inward Light-world: It dwelleth in the outward; and the outward receiveth power from it: It ſprouteth in the outward Power; and the outward <hi>knoweth nothing thereof;</hi> it only feeleth the power, but the Inward it cannot ſee or Behold: Only in its Lifes Looking-Glaſſe, it conceiveth the Glance thereof: For, the Inward power, maketh in the Outward Form a <hi>ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> according to it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. But Man, is the Inward and alſo the outward World, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the Inward World <hi>in himſelf;</hi> and ſo farre as belongs to him of the Dark world; he is all the Three Worlds; and if he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth ſtanding in like order or Equall <hi>Harmony,</hi> ſo that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduceth not one World into the other: Then he is <hi>Gods ſimilitude</hi> or likeneſs.</p>
                     <p n="20">20.<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> He ſhould introduce the form, <hi>viz:</hi> the Looking-Glaſſe of the Light-world, into the outward, alſo into the Moſt inward Dark-world, and bring the power of the <hi>middle</hi> or Light-world into the Looking-Glaſſe, and then he is <hi>capable</hi> of the divine Light: For the Subſtance conceiveth or apprehendeth not the Light, but the <hi>power</hi> of the Light; but the Looking-Glaſſe of the power apprehendeth or catcheth the Light, as the Water doth the Sun: For the Water is as a clear Looking-Glaſſe in <hi>compariſon</hi> of the Earth.</p>
                     <p n="21">
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:61437:31"/>21. But now if the Water be mixed with Earth, then it receiveth not the Sun's Light: So alſo, the humane Spirit or Soul <hi>receiveth not</hi> Gods Light, <hi>unleſſe</hi> it continue pure and ſetteth its deſire in or upon the pure, <hi>viz:</hi> into the Light; for whatſoever the Life<note n="*" place="margin">Deſireth, longeth or ſeeketh after.</note> imagineth after, that it receiveth.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. The Life of Man is the Form of <hi>both</hi> the inward Worlds. If the Life deſireth <hi>Sulphur</hi> in it ſelf; then is the <hi>Phur</hi> out of the <hi>Sul,</hi> its darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but if it deſireth <hi>Sul</hi> alone, then it receiveth the Lights power, and in the power, the Light with its property.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. For, in <hi>Phur,</hi> viz: in the fierce wrathfull Nature, the Life <hi>cannot</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue <hi>clear</hi> as a Looking-Glaſſe; but very well in <hi>Sul,</hi> for the <hi>Life of Man,</hi> is a true reall Looking-Glaſſe of the<note n="†" place="margin">Note.</note> Deity; wherein God beholdeth himſelf; He giveth his Glance and Power into the Humane Looking-Glaſſe; and findeth himſelf in Man, as alſo in Angels, and in the Forms or <hi>Beauties</hi> of Heaven.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. The Light-worlds Eſſence is <hi>his</hi> finding, or <hi>Revelation,</hi> and the Dark-worlds Eſſence is his <hi>looſing:</hi> He ſeeth not himſelf in the Dark-world; for it hath no Looking-Glaſſe which would be capable of the Light; all whatſoever<note n="*" place="margin">Or is of like Mind In Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Dark-world.</note> Imagineth according to the Dark-worlds Eſſence and Property, that receiveth the Dark-worlds Property; and <hi>Looſeth</hi> Gods Looking-Glaſſe.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. It becometh filled with dark fierce wrath; as a Man mixeth Water with Earth, and then the Sun cannot ſhine in it, and that very <hi>Water,</hi> loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Sun's Looking-Glaſſe; and the Water muſt again ſink down from the Earth, Elſe it never becometh a Looking-Glaſſe of the Sun any more, but is <hi>captivated</hi> in the fierce wrathfull Earth.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. Thus it goeth alſo with the Humane Life; while it Imagineth after or according to Gods Spirit, ſo it conceiveth or <hi>receiveth</hi> Gods Power and Light, and apprehendeth God; but when it imagineth after or according to Earthlineſs or according to the Dark-worlds Property; then it conceiveth or receiveth the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the Earthlineſs and Dark-world, and filleth it ſelf with the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. And then is the Lifes Looking Glaſſe, ſhut up in the darkneſſe; and looſeth the Looking-Glaſſe of the Deity, and muſt be born anew: As we know that <hi>Adam</hi> hath thus made the pure Looking-Glaſſe Earthly, and hath <hi>loſt</hi> Gods Power and Light; which Chriſt the Sonne of God hath <hi>reſtored</hi> again, and broke open the Earthly Darkneſſe, and hath with <hi>power</hi> and authority, introduced the Looking Glaſſe of the Deity.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. Thus we know, how the Holy Tree Sprouteth through all, and forth out of all Subſtances, and yet is comprehended by <hi>No Subſtance,</hi> but meerly in the Looking-Glaſſe of the Clearneſs or purity, <hi>viz:</hi> in the pure Life of Man; which Life, deſireth that Tree, and it can become compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended or apprehended, in no Dark Life.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Every <hi>Life,</hi> is a Clear<note n="*" place="margin">Glaſſe Glance Reflexion.</note> Glimpſe and Looking Glaſſe, and appeareth like a <hi>Flaſh</hi> of a terrible Aſpect or twinckling; but when the Flaſh catcheth or receiveth the Light, then it <hi>changeth</hi> it ſelf into a Meekneſs, and letteth the terror ſink down; for the Skreek or terrour uniteth it ſelf into the Light, and thus the Light <hi>ſhineth</hi> out of the terrible Flaſh; for the Flaſh is the Lights Eſſence, it is the Fire thereof.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Flaſh, containeth in it the Center of Nature; for, the <hi>fourth Form</hi> of Nature is the <hi>Flaſh;</hi> and there the Life ariſeth, which in the ſteddy Fire, as in the Principle, cometh to <hi>Perfection;</hi> but becometh ſet in the Light, <hi>viz:</hi> in another ſource or quality.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But now, the <hi>Originall</hi> of the Imagination is in the firſt Form of Nature, <hi>viz:</hi> in the deſirous harſh aſtringency; which bringeth <hi>its</hi> Form quite through the Dark-world, even into the Fire; for the firſt deſire goeth through all Formes, alſo it <hi>maketh</hi> all Formes, and driveth it ſelf on, into the Fire, even into the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And there is the Seperation-<hi>limit,</hi> of the Spirit; where it becometh generated; which is <hi>now free;</hi> it may enter back again, with its Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, into its Mother the Dark-world; or ſink down forward into the Fires anguiſh, and ſpring and grow forth in the Light, how it will; it ſtandeth in its choice or <hi>Election;</hi> into which it giveth up it ſelf, there it muſt be; for its Fire <hi>muſt have Subſtance,</hi> that it may have to Conſume.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Will the Spirit now Eat of its firſt Mother the harſhneſſe, that is, will it give to its Fire the fierce wrathful Subſtance in the <hi>Center,</hi> for food; or the Lights Subſtance in the Light-world; it ſtandeth <hi>all</hi> in its might and power, whatſoever its Fire embraceth or <hi>Conceiveth,</hi> in that property it burneth.</p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:61437:32"/>6. In the dark property, it <hi>burneth</hi> in the dark harſh ſtrong or ſtern ſource or quality, and ſeeth in it ſelf only a Flaſh; <hi>it hath only</hi> the Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glaſſe of the <hi>Darkneſſe,</hi> and ſeeth in the Darkneſs.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And in the Lights property, it catcheth or receiveth the <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of the Light, in which the Light-fire burneth; and ſeeth in the Light-world.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. All is nigh unto the Spirit, but it may not ſee in any other Worlds property, but only in <hi>that wherein its Fire burneth:</hi> That World alone is the Spirit capable of; it ſeeth not in the other World, for it hath no Eyes to do it, it continueth to be an Eternall <hi>hiddenneſs</hi> to it.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. If it have been in another World, and is gone out from thence, and hath given it ſelf up into another Fire; as the Devils did, <hi>who have</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>a knowledge</hi> of the Light-world, but no <hi>Experimentall</hi> perception or Seeing or beholding thereof, the Light world is neer unto them, and yet they know it not.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Thus now is to be known, the <hi>Lifes</hi> perdition; which is done in the Principle, there is the<note n="*" place="margin">Or Tongue of the Ballance.</note> Angle, there the Will may caſt or incline it ſelf whither it will; will it into the Multiplicity, <hi>to be its own Lord;</hi> then it can no otherwiſe apprehend the Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, but in the dark, ſtern, harſhneſſe or aſtringency, in the Dark-world.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. But will it into the Nothing into the Liberty; then muſt it <hi>give up</hi> it ſelf into the Fire, and then it ſinketh down into the Death of the Principle, and ſo it Sprouteth out of the Fires anguiſh, forth into the Light: For, whenſoever it yeildeth up it ſelf, then the Eternall Will bringeth it to Nature, which is God the Father, <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> forth through the Fire.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. For with the giving in, it falleth home, to the <hi>firſt</hi> willing to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And that bringeth it with the <hi>ſecond</hi> willing which is its Heart or Sonne, forth out of the Anguiſh of Nature; and ſetteth it with the Sonnes Will in the Liberty without or beyond the Fire-ſource or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and there, it getteth <hi>for the Multiplicity, the</hi>

                        <hi>ALL;</hi> not to its own Glory Authority or Power, but to Gods Glory and Power; God is in it, its willing and doing.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. But whatſoever will be Lord in the Fire, that goeth into its own<note n="*" place="margin">Or dwelling.</note> Number, in its own Subſtance which it ſelf is: And whatſoever giveth up its <hi>power,</hi> that giveth up alſo its Fire-burning; and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth home to <hi>that, which is a cauſe</hi> of the Fire, <hi>viz:</hi> to the Eternall willing of God.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. And thus, in the Liberty, it is fallen without or beyond its ſource-or-quality-Fire, and the <hi>Liberty</hi> kindleth <hi>its Fire:</hi> And now it is become a Light to it, and a Clear Looking Glaſſe; for it hath given up it ſelf into the Liberty, <hi>viz:</hi> into God; And thus its Fire is a ſhining and Glance of GODS Majeſty.</p>

                     <p n="16">16. Whatſoever giveth it ſelf up into Nature, but deſireth not the property of Nature, but the Liberty; that becometh in its Flaſh of Life, <hi>kindled with the Liberty;</hi> in that manner, as the Second Principle <hi>hath</hi> kindled it ſelf <hi>from Eternity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="17">17. Thus we underſtand <hi>how</hi> a Life periſheth, how it introduceth it ſelf into anguiſh and the painfull ſource or quality in the darkneſs; <hi>viz:</hi> when it will be its own Lord, and deſireth the Multiplicity; when it will not give it Self up into <hi>Death;</hi> and then it cannot reach or attain any other World.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. For every Life, exiſteth in the Anguiſh ſource in Nature; and hath no Light in it ſelf, <hi>unleſſe</hi> it entereth into that which cauſeth Nature; <hi>there</hi> it receiveth or conceiveth the Light.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. For, all whatſoever is in Nature, is dark and in Anguiſh; as is to be known in this World; if the Sun ſhould be taken away, then <hi>all would be</hi> meer anguiſh and Darkneſs: And therefore hath God moved himſelf, that he might give a <hi>Light to this World,</hi> that the outward Life might ſtand in the Light.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. But concerning the inward Life of Souls, it hath another manner or Form, the outward <hi>cannot attain</hi> this inward Life; and if the Souls-fire hath not Gods Light, then <hi>alſo</hi> cannot the Souls-will enter into Gods Light, it muſt continue in the Darkneſs of the Eternall Nature.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. Outward Reaſon ſuppoſeth, when the outward Eyes Seeth a thing, <hi>that is all,</hi> there is no other Seeing More; indeed it is bad enough when the Poor Soul borroweth the outward Looking-Glaſſe, and muſt make ſhift to <hi>help it ſelf</hi> only with that; But where will its ſeeing remain when the outward Looking-Glaſſe breaketh; wherewith will it then ſee? With the anxious Fire-flaſh in the Abomination in the darkneſs? It can ſee no other where.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. Therefore it often cometh to paſſe, that when the poor captive Soul diſcovereth or <hi>deſcrieth</hi> it ſelf in the inward Root, and thinketh what will follow, when the outward Looking Glaſſe breaketh, that it is horribly terrified and precipitateth, or caſteth the <hi>body</hi> into Anguiſh and doubting.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. For, it can no where diſcover, where its Eternall Reſt ſhould be; but it findeth, <hi>that it is</hi> in it ſelf in meer unquietneſs, moreover in darkneſſe; and hath the outward Looking-Glaſſe, <hi>only,</hi> as it were, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. For while the Soul, ſticketh in this outward Body, it may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed make a ſhift <hi>to help it ſelf,</hi> with the Sun-Looking-Glaſſe, for the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61437:33"/> Sun hath in its Root, the inward Fire; <hi>viz:</hi> the Principle of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. <hi>From that</hi> very Fire, it getteth a Glance or Looking-Glaſſe; which is a cauſe of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the Body; ſo that it can in this Earthly tranſitory Life; be in Joy: But when the outward Looking-Glaſſe breaketh, then that is out or extinguiſhed, and the Souls fire goeth into the houſe of Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Sorrow, <hi>viz:</hi> into the <hi>Center</hi> of the Darkneſs.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. The Soul hath in the Time of the outward Body, Three Looking-Glaſſes <hi>or Eyes,</hi> of all the Three Worlds, and into which Looking-Glaſſe, it inclineth or turneth in it ſelf; out of that it ſeeth; but it hath no more but <hi>one</hi> as to the right of Nature; that is, <hi>the Fire-Flaſh,</hi> viz: the fourth Form of the Dark-world; in the Place, where the Principle ariſeth; where the two inward Worlds ſever themſelves, one into the Darkneſs, the other into the Light; there is its Eternall <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="27">27. Into which World now it introduceth its willing, in that ſame it receiveth alſo the Subſtance, <hi>viz:</hi> a <hi>Spirituall Body;</hi> for that very Subſtance, becometh, to the Souls-Fire, a Food or Matter of its burning.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. And therefore hath God introduced the Soul into Fleſh and Bloud, that it might <hi>not ſo eaſily,</hi> be capable of the fierce wrathfull Subſtance; alſo it hath its Joy the while in the Sun's Looking-Glaſſe, and rejoyceth it ſelf in the <hi>Sydereall Eſſence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="29">29. And 1. The Light-world ſtandeth in its right Fire, <hi>viz:</hi> in the firſt Principle, <hi>preſented</hi> to it. 2. The Dark-world in the Fire-<hi>Root.</hi> But 3. the outward Elementary World in the <hi>Starres</hi>-ſources or quality; where between, moveth the Great Myſterie of the Soules-Fire: In which World now it uniteth and giveth up it ſelf; from the ſame <hi>it getteth Subſtance</hi> in its Imagination.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. But ſeeing, with <hi>Adam,</hi> it hath turned it ſelf into the Spirit of this World, and brought its Imagination thereinto, therefore now its <hi>higheſt deſire</hi> ſtandeth in the Sun's and Starre's ſource or quality, and draweth with the ſame, the Spirit of the outward World, with its Subſtance of the four Elements conſtantly, into it ſelf, and hath its greateſt <hi>Joy</hi> therein; in which it is a Gueſt in a ſtrange Lodging; for the Abyſſe ſtandeth <hi>under it,</hi> and it is in great Danger.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. Now ſaith outward Reaſon: Hath God indeed Created it in Fleſh and Bloud in this outward World? What <hi>hurt</hi> may that doe it?</p>
                     <p n="32">32. This Reaſon, knoweth no more of the Originall of the Soul, then a Cow doth of a New Barn-Door, which looketh at it, and ſuppoſeth it to be <hi>ſomewhat ſtrange:</hi> And ſo alſo the outward Reaſon, ſuppoſeth the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward World to be ſome ſtrange thing.</p>

                     <p n="34">34. It findeth indeed the longing after God, but the <hi>outward World</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="margin">Wichret.</note> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth that, and covereth it; ſo that the deſire after Gods World, may not kindle the Fire in it ſelf: For if that were done, then would the Light-World become Manifeſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p n="35">35. The <hi>Devill alſo</hi> hindereth this; who poſſeſſeth the Root of this World in the Souls-Fire, and <hi>ſetteth</hi> alwayes Evill Earthly<note n="*" place="margin">Things Matters or Doings.</note> Subſtantiality before the Soul; or ſtirreth indeed, the Root in the Center of Nature, in the fierce wrath, ſo that the poor Soul, either kindleth it ſelf in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-fire in the <hi>Evill</hi> poyſon ſource or quality; or elſe kindleth it ſelf in the Anguiſh and doubting of Gods Love: And <hi>there</hi> he hath gotten the Day or the Game.</p>
                     <p n="36">36. And ſetteth before the Soul outward Might or Potency, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Honour, alſo the Glance Luſtre and Pomp of the outward World, and there the Soul <hi>biteth</hi> at that, and <hi>Tickleth</hi> it ſelf therein with or by Imagination: And yet it cannot rightly enjoy the ſame, for it is, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a <hi>borrowed</hi> Looking-Glaſſe.</p>
                     <p n="37">37. Thus the poor Soul becometh drawn away from Gods Light, and ſinketh alwayes into <hi>perdition, viz:</hi> into the dark Houſe of Miſery, in the Dark-world: And that <hi>Adam</hi> procured and Cook't, for us, when he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced his delight or Luſt into the Earthlineſs: And thus now the poor Soul <hi>Swimmeth</hi> in the Earthly Fleſh and Bloud, and Continually <hi>eateth</hi> of the Tempting Tree of Evill and Good, and is vehemently drawn by <hi>both;</hi> and the Serpents Monſter ſticketh in the Midſt, in the Source or Quality of the fierce wrath; and Continually bloweth up, the Anger and the fierce wrath.</p>

We cannot ſay thus of the Devill, that he ſitteth in Grief or <hi>ſadneſſe</hi> as if he were in ſad deſpair, there is no ſad deſpair in him, but a Continuall Will, <hi>more</hi> to kindle the Poyſon Source or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that his fierce Wrath may become the greater, for he is its Strength, wherein he createth or <hi>frameth</hi> his willing to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Thrones, and to kindle them; he will in the Poyſon Source or Quality be a mighty potent Lord: For it is the Strong and Great Life.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. But the <hi>Light</hi> is to him <hi>his</hi> miſery and deſpairing, that allayeth his Pomp; at which he is terrified; for it is his right Poyſon, which paineth or <hi>Tormenteth</hi> him; therefore, becauſe he hath loſt it; and therefore now it ſtandeth oppoſed to him; of which he is very much aſhamed, that he is a <hi>deformed</hi> Angel in a ſtrange Image.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. He would be content with<note n="†" place="margin">Or the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</note> the fierce wrathfull Source, if the Light were <hi>not</hi> ſo neer him, therefore is the ſhame ſo great in him, that he giveth it over, and alwayes <hi>kindleth</hi> the more vehemently, his poyſonous Source or Quality, ſo that his Figure alwayes becometh the <hi>more abominable,</hi> and that the Divine Image in him might NOT be known.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. Therefore, he bends his endeavours after that, whereby, and how
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61437:41"/> he may rave and <hi>rage</hi> againſt God, as if he were ſome ſtrange thing, or were a ſtrange or forrain Power; as if he had a ſtrange or Forraign Kingdome, <hi>whereas yet he is poor,</hi> and the dark Kingdome is <hi>not his,</hi> but he is only a Priſoner or <hi>Captive</hi> therein.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. <hi>It</hi> is Gods Abyſſe, he the Devill, is but a Creature therein, he would be Lord therein, yet is but a Jugler with the fierce wrathful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, though indeed he muſt doe as the Qualities Property is: And is alſo a Wonder before the ſtrong or ſtern Might of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. It is as a Sport or <hi>Scene,</hi> wherewith the ſtrong or ſtern Might hath its effect or recreation, whereby it is diſtinguiſhed what Evill or Good, is, Joy or Sorrow, and that the Creatures in the Light-world, <hi>have cauſe to humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="25">25. Though indeed God Created no Devill, <hi>alſo</hi> not <hi>Lucifer,</hi> for the Dark-world; and this is the Enmity with <hi>Lucifer,</hi> that he hath been an Angell, and that the Light is ſo near him, that he is become a Caſt-away or Apoſtate.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. Elſe, in the Creatures which have been <hi>Created</hi> in the Dark-world, there is <hi>no Woe:</hi> For they are the fierce wrathfull Property, and know Nothing of the Light: Fierce wrathfulneſſe is their Strength and Might; and enimicitiouſneſs is their Willing and <hi>Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="27">27. The Eviller and more enimicitious a Creature in the Dark-world, is, the greater is its <hi>might:</hi> As the Mighty or Potent Tyrants of this World, doe often make their Might in Malignity or Wickedneſs to be ſeen, ſo that men <hi>muſt fear</hi> them: Or as the Tame Beaſts are afraid of the Evill fierce wrathfull wild ones, juſt ſuch a Property alſo it hath in the Dark-world.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. When we will rightly conceive of the Property of the Dark-world, let us look but upon the Malignity <hi>Malice</hi> or Wickedneſs and Pride or State <hi>of this World,</hi> which is a Type Prefiguration or Repreſentat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="29">29. The Dark-world giveth to this World, Eſſence Willing and Property, and if the Good were not created <hi>together, in it,</hi> then there would be no other Will or Doing in this World, then is in the Dark-world.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. But the Divine <hi>Power</hi> and the Sun'<hi>s Light</hi> hindereth that, as is to be ſeen among Men, and Beaſts, what a biting Enmity, ſtriking, proud ſtately Will, the own ſelf-will, is, where every Will would dominere over the other, and worry and devour the other, and only lift up it <hi>ſelf,</hi>

                     <p n="31">31. <hi>What</hi> all evill wicked malicious Men in this World doe in their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice wickedneſs and falſhood, <hi>that</hi> alſo the Devils doe in the Dark-world; and what the poyſonous evill <hi>Wormes</hi> and <hi>Beaſts</hi> in their Malignity doe, that doe alſo the other Creatures in the Dark-world.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. Though indeed <hi>they</hi> are without ſuch Bodies, yet they have <hi>ſuch</hi> a Property in their Spirituall Body, and though indeed they have <hi>Bodies,</hi> yet it is after a <hi>ſpirituall manner,</hi> as the Devils have.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. The Dark-worlds Birth or Geniture, Subſtance, Eſſence, and Dominion, ſtandeth principally only in the <hi>firſt four</hi> Formes of Nature, <hi>viz:</hi> in the anxious Source or Quality, in a very exceeding ſtrong and mighty potent Dominion, where all in the Eſſence is loud-ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. For, the <hi>Meekneſs</hi> is the Enmity, of the <hi>fierce</hi> wrathfull Might or Power; and indeed, the one is againſt the other: Elſe if they ſhould be ONE, there would alſo be but <hi>one only</hi> Source or <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>

                     <p n="36">36.

And <hi>then</hi> how he may again <hi>quench</hi> the fierce wrathfull Source or Quality; which is Stirring in him, ſeeing ALL is <hi>ſtirring</hi> in him, and that Evill and Good draweth him; therefore he ſhould learn, how he may withſtand the fierce Wrath, and may walk and converſe in Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Source or Quality of the Light and of the Love.</p>

                     <p n="42">42. So long as a thing continueth in the Eſſence, out of which it is exiſted, <hi>ſo long</hi> it hath no Law, but when it departeth out from thence into another Source or Quality, then the firſt Source or Quality cleaveth to it, and lyeth with the other in ſtrife, and <hi>now</hi> the Law <hi>purſueth</hi> it, that it ſhould enter again into that which it was in the originall, <hi>and be one</hi> not two: for one onely thing ſhould drive on one only Dominion <hi>not two.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="43">43. Man was created in the Dominion of the Love and Meekneſſe, <hi>viz:</hi> in Gods Subſtance, therein he was to continue: But ſeeing he hath <hi>awakened</hi> to himſelf yet another Dominion, <hi>viz:</hi> the fierce Wrath now he is in ſtrife, and hath Law upon him, that he mortifie and forſake the fierce Wrath, and be in <hi>One</hi> dominion again.</p>
                     <p n="44">44. If then <hi>both</hi> Dominions are become mighty in him, and that the fierce wrathfull Dominion hath overpowered or vanquiſhed the Love, then he muſt totally <hi>diſſolve</hi> in the Subſtance, and become new born or generated again out of the firſt Root; and therefore he hath in this <hi>Twofold</hi> Subſtance, Law upon him, how he ſhall behave himſelf, and generate or bring forth a Will-Spirit to the Eternall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.</p>
                     <p n="45">45.

                     <p n="46">46. And then, when the<note n="†" place="margin">Or Hearb.</note> Weed ſeparateth from this Field of the Body: Then it is in one Dominion again: And <hi>there</hi> it ſhall continue Eternally, for hereafter there is nothing more that can give it Law, <hi>for it is totally One only</hi> in its willing, either to doe Evill, or Good.</p>
                     <p n="47">47. But in this outward Life, Man ſtandeth in Strife, and there <hi>Two</hi> Dominions ſway in him, of a <hi>twofold</hi> Source or <hi>Quality</hi> and <hi>Law:</hi> The one the divine, to Love and Righteouſneſs; Secondly, the other, the fierce wrathfull one, in the riſing up of Pride and State, in the Fires Might, in

                     <p n="48">48. To which then the Spirit inclineth uniteth or <hi>appropriateth</hi> it ſelf, of that Dominion it is: The other cleaveth to it, and reproacheth it to its Face, as a perjured Apoſtate, yet draweth it, and would have it; thus the Life <hi>ſticketh</hi> between both, in the Preſſe, and is ever at odds with it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="49">49. But when it departeth away, and <hi>totally</hi> giveth it ſelf home to the fierce Wrath, then the fierce Wrath, deſtroyeth the firſt Image accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God; but if it <hi>cannot totally,</hi> becauſe the divine Power hindereth it, yet will the fierce wrath, thruſt the whole Man headlong and will caſt Many headlong into <hi>Deſpaire</hi> in that anguiſh, ſo that he kills himſelf or putteth himſelf to Death.</p>
                     <p n="50">50. And thus the Soul falleth with the Image, home to the fierce wrathfull Dark-world, and the Image is brought into a helliſh Figure, into a Form or <hi>Condition of its Property</hi> which it had here.</p>
                     <p n="51">51. For, thus, it is alſo come to paſſe, with the Devils, who have loſt their firſt Image: Every Devill, hath now <hi>his</hi> Image according to <hi>his</hi> Property, according to the fierce Wraths Figure, according to its Source or Quality, like as there are horrible <hi>Wormes</hi> or Evill Beaſts, and ſuch a thing the loſt Soul alſo hath to expect.</p>

                     <p n="16">16.

                     </p>
                     <p n="20">20. Thus the Tongue giveth God Good words, and the Heart hath the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>four Elements</hi> of the Fierce wrath, and ſo God becometh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached by the Devill, that God ſhould thereby ſee, that he the Devill is Lord and King over Men.</p>
                     <p n="21">21.

                     <p n="23">23. The Devill <hi>dare not</hi> kill any Man, but that doth Man readily for him to pleaſe him: Alſo the Devill <hi>cannot</hi> uſe the Creatures of God, and yet Man miſuſeth them readily to pleaſe <hi>him;</hi> thereby to reproach God.</p>
                     <p n="24">24.

                     <p n="57">57. Thus, theſe are the four Elements of the Dark-world: in which the Devill ſuppoſeth to be a God; wherewith he ruleth upon Earth with <hi>his faithfull</hi> Sonne Falſhood; which firſt is the Smugge <hi>Kitlin,</hi> which before hand giveth good words, and yet watcheth continually upon the <hi>Mouſe;</hi> if it can but once catch it: O how brisk and Jocund it is, when it can bring the <hi>Roaſtmeat</hi> to the Devill.</p>
                     <p n="58">58. With theſe <hi>Four Elements</hi> is Man ſurrounded, and hath them in the falſe Kings Land and Country, for his Lodging: They Shoot him at an houres <hi>to the Heart,</hi> and would Murther his Noble Image.</p>
                     <p n="59">59. He muſt continually be in Strife againſt theſe: For they are with and <hi>in him,</hi> as in a Lodging: They ſtand alwayes upon him: And would Murther <hi>his beſt</hi> Jewell.</p>
                     <p n="60">60. If but one of theſe Four Elements have power and Authority to qualifie or operate in Man; then <hi>that One</hi> kindleth <hi>all</hi> the other, and inſtantly robbeth Man of his Noble Image, and maketh out of it, a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of the Devill.</p>
                     <p n="61">61. And none can with truth ſay; who letteth <hi>theſe Four</hi> Elements have power and authority to qualifie or operate; that he is a Man; for he qualifieth or operateth in the Devils <hi>property,</hi> and is an Enemy of God.</p>

                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:61437:47"/>62. And though perhaps the Devill cloateth him with the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Hypocriticall Mantle, ſo that he can give good words, and knoweth how to behave himſelf <hi>finely,</hi> that a Man ſuppoſeth he is a Childe of God: yet for all that he is no Man, <hi>ſo long</hi> as theſe four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, lead the <hi>upper</hi> dominion.</p>
                     <p n="63">63. But he is a <hi>Devillized</hi> Man, half Devill and half Man, till he maketh his meaſure full; and then he is a Totall Devill in Mans Form or Shape.</p>
                     <p n="64">64.<note n="*" place="margin">NOTE.</note> Therefore let every one learn to know what kind of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties rule in him, if he find that theſe four Elements or <hi>but one of them</hi> rule in him, then he hath time to draw into Battle againſt <hi>it,</hi> or elſe it will not be Good; he ſhould <hi>not dare</hi> to comfort himſelf with the Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
                     <p n="65">65. Only let him not ſuffer the Devill to caſt the flattering Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall Mantle about him, as is done now adayes, when Men live <hi>in theſe four Elements,</hi> and doe but finely tickle themſelves with the Sufferings of Chriſt, that muſt be this wicked mans Cloak and Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                     <hi>The Firſt Point.</hi> Of the Bloud and Water of the Soul.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. ALL whatſoever is Subſtantiall and <hi>palpable,</hi> is in or belonging to <hi>this</hi> World. Now, ſince, the Soul is not a Subſtance or Being, in or of this World; therefore its Bloud and Water, is <hi>not</hi> a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in, or of, this World.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Indeed, the Soul, together with its Bloud and Water; is, in the <hi>outward</hi> Bloud and Water, but its Subſtance is Magicall, for the Soul is even a <hi>Magick</hi> Fire, and its Image or Form is generated in the Light, (in the power of its Fire and Light,) out of the Magick Fire, and yet is a true Image in Fleſh and Bloud; <hi>viz:</hi> in the <hi>Originall</hi> thereof.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As, the Wiſdome of God <hi>hath</hi> a Subſtance; and yet the Wiſdome it Self <hi>is no</hi> Subſtance: So, the Soul together with its Image, <hi>hath</hi> a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and yet the Soul is only a Magick Fire, but its Suſtenance or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is from its <hi>Subſtance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. For, as Fire muſt have a Subſtance, if it muſt Burn, ſo the Magick Fire of the Soul alſo, hath Fleſh, Bloud, and Water; for no Bloud could be, if the Tincture of the Fire and Light, were not, in the Water, which is the <hi>Ens</hi> or Life of the Wiſdome; and that hath in it all the Formes of Nature; and it is the other or <hi>Second</hi> Magick Fire.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For it affordeth all Colours, and out of or from its Forme, the Divine Power goeth forth in the <hi>Meek</hi> Subſtance of the Light, underſtand, according to the Property of the Light: And according to the Property of the Fire, it is a Sharpneſs of Tranſmutation or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and can drive on every thing to its higheſt Pitch or Degree, though it ſelf, be no<note n="*" place="margin">Corporeall.</note> living Spirit, but the <hi>higheſt</hi> ENS.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Thus alſo, it is Such an Ens in the Water; and driveth forth therein, both the Property of the Fire and of the Light, together with all Powers of Nature: Where then it <hi>turneth the Water into Bloud,</hi> and this it doth, both in the inward and outward Water; <hi>viz:</hi> in the outward and inward Bloud.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The inward Bloud of the Divine Subſtance or<note n="†" place="margin">Or Eſſence.</note> Subſtantiality, is alſo Magicall, for the <hi>Magia</hi> maketh it to be a Subſtance: it is Spirituall Bloud, and which cannot be <hi>touched</hi> or ſtirred, by the outward Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>but by the Imagination only:</hi> The inward Imagination driveth on the outward Will in the inward Bloud; whence the Fleſh and Bloud of the Divine Subſtantiality,<note n="*" place="margin">Or periſheth.</note> fadeth; and <hi>ſo</hi> the Noble Image of the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude</hi> of God, becometh Darkened or Obſcured.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61437:53"/>8. The Fleſh and Bloud of the Soul, is, or Conſiſteth, in the higheſt <hi>Myſtery;</hi> for it is divine Subſtantiallity, and when the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Fleſh and Bloud dyeth, then it falleth home to the higheſt <hi>Myſterie,</hi> and the outward Myſterie falleth home to the Inward.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And <hi>each</hi> Magick Fire, hath its clarity or brightneſs, and darkneſs in it ſelf, for which things Sake, a Finall day of Separation is appointed, wherein all ſhall paſſe through the Fire, and be tried what is capable of it, and what is not, and then every thing goeth into its own <hi>Magia,</hi> and is afterwards <hi>as it was alwayes</hi> from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. For, every Form taketh its Feeling, from the Originall of the <hi>Firſt Three</hi> Formes in Nature, <hi>viz:</hi> from the Harſhneſſe, Bitterneſſe, and

                  <p n="16">16. The Humane Life is the Angle between<note n="†" place="margin">Or Love-Fire.</note> Light and Darkneſſe, to which ſoever it giveth up uniteth or inclineth it ſelf, in that it burneth; if it giveth it ſelf up into the <hi>Deſire of</hi>

                  <p n="18">18. Now, when the <hi>Life</hi> is generated, it hath all the Three Worlds in it; And to what World the Life inclineth or appropriateth it Self, it is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and preſerved by that, and kindled in the Fire <hi>thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. For, when the Life kindleth it ſelf, it becometh drawn by all the Three Worlds, and they ſtand in the wreſtling in the Eſſence, <hi>viz:</hi> in the <hi>firſt kindled</hi> Fire; and which Eſſence ſoever the Life in its deſire draweth in and receiveth, its Fire, burneth.</p>

If the <hi>firſt Eſſence,</hi> in which the Life kindled it ſelf, be good, then is that Fire alſo pleaſant and good, but if it be Evill and Dark, from a wrathfull or fierce property, then is that alſo, a wrathfull or fierce Fire; and hath again <hi>ſuch a Deſire;</hi> according to the Property of the Fire.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. For, every Imagination deſireth only Subſtance in its <hi>likeneſs,</hi> wherein it doth exiſt.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. The Life of Man in this Time, is like a Wheel, where very Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, that which is undermoſt becometh uppermoſt, and kindleth it ſelf in every Subſtance, and defileth it ſelf with every Subſtance, yet its Bath or Laver, is the <hi>Moving</hi> of the Heart of God, a Water of <hi>Meekneſſe,</hi> and out of that, it may in its Fire-Life, drive forth the Subſtance.

                  <p n="23">23. For, the firſt Eſſence, is only the <hi>Myſterie</hi> or towards Life, and belongeth properly to the firſt Life, togetner with the kindling in the

                  <p n="25">25. The Election or Predeſtination paſſeth upon <hi>that</hi> which is <hi>introduced:</hi> Whether it belong to the Light or to the Darkneſs; for, of whatſoever property it is, according to that alſo is the <hi>Will</hi> of its Life; It becometh known whether it be of the fierce wrathfull Eſſence, or of the Meek Love-Eſſence; And ſo long as it burneth in the <hi>One</hi> Fire, it is left or forſaken of the other; and the Election or Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of that Fire wherein it burneth, paſſeth upon that Life; for that willeth to have it, it is of its own property.</p>

                  <head>The Third Point. <hi>Of</hi> Sinne. <hi>What</hi> Sinne <hi>is. And</hi> how <hi>it is</hi> Sinne.</head>
                  <p n="28">28. A Thing which is but only ONE, hath neither Commandment nor Law; but if it <hi>mixeth</hi> it ſelf with another, then there are two Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances or Eſſences in One, and there are alſo two Wills, one whereof, runneth contrary to the other, and <hi>thence</hi> ariſeth Enmity.</p>
                  <p n="20">
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61437:54"/>29. Thus, we are to conſider and Conceive, of the Enmity againſt God, God is ſimply One, and Good, without any Source, and although, every Source is in HIM, yet not Manifeſted; for the Good hath ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up the Evill or that which is Contrary, into it ſelf; and keepeth it in the Good by Compulſion, in <hi>Subjection,</hi> as a Captive, where the Evill muſt be a cauſe of the Life and of the Light, yet, not Manifeſted; but the <hi>Good</hi> ſlayeth or Mortifyeth the <hi>Evill,</hi> that it ſelf in the Evill, may dwell in it ſelf, without Source or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. The Love and the Enmity, is but <hi>One</hi> only Thing, yet each of them dwelleth in it Self, and that maketh Two things: Death is the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Wall between them <hi>both;</hi> and yet there is no Death but this, that the Good dyeth from the Evill; as the Light is Dead to the Source of the Fire, and feeleth the Fire no more.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. Now, thus we may in the Humane Life, fathom or ſearch out, <hi>Sinne,</hi> for, the Life is Singly <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> but if there be another Source therein then what is Good, then, that, is an Enmity againſt God, for God dwelleth in the Higheſt or pretiouſeſt Life of Man.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. Now, no unfathomable thing, <hi>can dwell</hi> in that which is fathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for as ſoon as the right Life awakeneth the Source in it Self; that <hi>is not</hi> like unto the <hi>Abyſſe</hi> wherein there is no Source: And ſo immediately the One <hi>ſeparateth</hi> it ſelf from the Other.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. For, the<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> Good, or the Light, is as a Nullity or <hi>Nothing;</hi> but if <hi>Somewhat</hi> cometh into it, then that Somewhat is another thing then that Nullity or Nothing; for that Somewhat dwelleth in it ſelf in the Source, for where there is Somewhat, <hi>there muſt be</hi> a Source which maketh and preſerveth that Somewhat.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. Thus, we are to conſider, of Love and Enmity; Love hath <hi>One</hi> only Source and Will, it deſireth only its like and not <hi>Multiplicity,</hi> for the Good <hi>is ſingly</hi> ONE, but the ſource or Quality <hi>is</hi> Manifold; and, whatſoever humane Will, deſireth much, that, <hi>fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="35">35. For, the <hi>Somewhat</hi> is dark, and darkneth the Light of Life; and the <hi>One</hi> is Light, for it loveth it ſelf, and there is no deſire after any thing More.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. And thus muſt the Will of the Life be tending and <hi>endeavouring</hi> into the One, <hi>viz:</hi> into the Good, and then it remaineth in one only Source, but if it Imagineth <hi>in or after</hi> another Source, it is preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or in travell with that thing which it luſteth or longeth after.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. And if then, that thing be <hi>without</hi> an Eternall and Ground and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and in a Frail Corruptible Root, then it ſelf ſeeketh a Root to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61437:55"/> it, that it ſelf may remain; for <hi>all Life</hi> ſubſiſteth in the Magick Fire, and thereupon every Subſtance muſt have a Fire wherein it Self burneth.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. And then that Thing muſt make to it ſelf a Subſtance <hi>according</hi> to its Deſire, that its Fire may have food to feed upon; Now, no Fire-Source, can Subſiſt in the<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> Free-fire or Fire of the Liberty; for it reacheth not that becauſe that is ONE, of, or by, it Self.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. Whatſoever would Subſiſt in God, muſt empty it Self of its own Will, it muſt have no Fire burning in Self, but the Fire of God, or <hi>the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Fire,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Note.</note> muſt be its Fire; Its Self will muſt be united in to God; ſo that the Will of God, and the Will and Spirit of Man, may be but One, and the <hi>Same.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="40">40. For that which is one is <hi>not</hi> at Enmity, for it hath but one only Will; whitherſoever it goeth, or whatſoever it doeth, <hi>that is all one</hi> with it.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. One only Will hath but one only Imagination, and yet the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="42">42. God dwelleth in ALL, and there is NOTHING that Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth him, unleſſe it be one with him; and if it departeth out of that One, then doth it depart out from God, into it Self, and is <hi>ſomewhat elſe beſides</hi> God;<note place="margin">Note.</note> and that Divideth or Separateth it Self. And hence the Law doth exiſt, that it muſt either goe again out of it Self, into that One, or elſe be ſeparated from that One.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. Thus; It may be known, what <hi>Sinne</hi> is, or <hi>How</hi> it is <hi>Sinne:</hi> viz: the Humane Will which ſeparateth it ſelf from God into its own Selfneſſe, and awakeneth its own ſelf, and burneth in its own Source; and ſo that<note n="†" place="margin">Self Luſt and Deſire.</note> 
                     <hi>own</hi> Fire, is thus, <hi>not capable</hi> of the<note n="*" place="margin">Divine Longing and Deſire.</note> divine Fire.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. For, all that the Will entreth into, and will have as its own, that is a <hi>ſtrange</hi> Thing or Subſtance in the One only Will of God; for the Will of God, is <hi>All things,</hi> and Mans own Will is <hi>Nothing;</hi> but if it be in God, ALL, is its own, alſo.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. Thus we know, The <hi>Deſire of Luſt</hi> to be Sinne: For it Luſteth, and ſo departeth out of One into Many, and introduceth Much into the One: It willeth to poſſeſs as its own, and yet <hi>ſhould be</hi> at Liberty and without Willing; By the Deſire, Subſtance is ſought, and in the Subſtance the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire <hi>kindleth</hi> the Fire.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. Now every Fire burneth out of the Property of its Subſtance: and then is the Separation and Enmity generated. For, Chriſt ſaid.<note n="†" place="margin">Math. 12.30. Luke 11.23.</note> 
                     <hi>He that is not with me is againſt me, and he that gathereth not with me ſcattereth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61437:55"/> abroad;</hi> for he gathereth without him, and whatſoever is not in him, is without God.</p>
                  <p n="47">47. Thus we perceive that Covetouſneſſe is Sinne: For it is a Deſire<note n="*" place="margin">Extra Deum.</note> 
                     <hi>without</hi> God, and we ſee alſo that Pride is Sinne, for it will be its own and <hi>ſeparateth</hi> it ſelf from God, <hi>viz:</hi> from the Only One.</p>
                  <p n="48">48. For, whoſoever will be in God, muſt walk in HIM; <hi>in his Will;</hi> For, ſeeing we are, in God, but One in Many Members; therefore it is <hi>againſt</hi> and Contrary to God, when one Member withdraweth it ſelf from the Other, and Maketh it ſelf a <hi>Sole</hi> and only Lord; and ſo there be <hi>two</hi> Lords, and the One Severeth it ſelf from the Other.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. Therefore all is Sinne, and a Contrary Oppoſite Will, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Deſire poſſeſſeth as its <hi>own,</hi> for it ſelf only, be it meat or drink, if the Will imagineth or ſetteth it ſelf therein, then it filleth it ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and kindleth the Fire thereof, and ſo <hi>another</hi> Fire burneth in the firſt, which is a Contrary Oppoſite Will, and an Errour.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. Therefore, there muſt a <hi>new will</hi> grow out of this Oppoſite Will, that ſo it may give up it ſelf again into that One only Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Contrary Oppoſite Will muſt be <hi>broken</hi> and ſlain.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. And here, we are to Conſider of the<note n="†" place="margin">John 1.14.</note> Word, God, <hi>which became Man,</hi> and that if a Man ſet his deſire therein, he departeth out of the Source, out of his own Fire, and becometh Regenerated a new in the Word, and ſo the Will, that is <hi>thus departed,</hi> dwelleth in God, and the <hi>firſt Will</hi> dwelleth in the Deſire, in the Earthlineſſe and Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
                  <p n="52">52. And ſo the Multiplicity muſt Corrupt with the Body, and dye from the Will that is departed; and the Will that is departed, is then known to be a new Birth; for it reaſſumes all again into it ſelf, in that One; but <hi>not</hi> with its <hi>own</hi> Self deſire, but with its own Love which is united with and in God; ſo that, God, <hi>is</hi>

                     <hi>all in all,</hi> and his Will is the Will of all things; for one only Will ſubſiſteth in God.</p>
                  <p n="53">53. And thus we find, that the Evill<note n="†" place="margin">

                     <hi>muſt be ſerviceable to the Good</hi> unto Life; if the Will departeth out again from it Self into the Good; for, the Wrath and Fierceneſſe muſt become the Fire of Life.</p>
                  <p n="54">54. But the Will of the Life muſt be ſet in Strife, againſt it Self, for <hi>it muſt fly</hi> from the Wrath, and not will it; it muſt not will that Deſire, which yet will and alſo muſt have its Fire: Therefore is it ſaid,<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 3.3, 5, 7.</note> 
                     <hi>We muſt be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated</hi> in the Will.</p>
                  <p n="55">55.

                  <p n="57">57. The Will, as alſo that Deſire, in or towards Meat and Drink is Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Separated from God; but that Will which flyeth from the Earthly Deſire, burneth in the inward Fire, <hi>and is</hi> Divine.</p>

                  <p n="65">65. THe <hi>Magia</hi> is the Mother of the Eternity, of the Subſtance of all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; for it <hi>maketh</hi> it ſelf, and is underſtood<note n="*" place="margin">Or to be the Deſire.</note> in the Deſire.</p>
                  <p n="66">66. It is in it ſelf, no other then a Will, and that Will is the <hi>Myſterium Magnum,</hi> the Great Myſterie of all Wonders and Secrets, and yet it dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth forth it Self, through the <hi>Imagination</hi> of the deſiring Hunger, into Subſtance.</p>
                  <p n="67">67. It is the Originall of Nature, its deſire maketh a<note n="*" place="margin">Impreſſion or Imaging in a Thing.</note> Repreſentation, this <hi>Repreſentation</hi> is no other then the Will of the Deſire, yet the Deſire maketh in the Will, ſuch a Subſtance as the Will in it ſelf, is.</p>
                  <p n="68">68. The true <hi>Magia</hi> is no Subſtance, but the deſiring <hi>Spirit</hi> of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; it is an un-ſubſtantiall <hi>Mutrix,</hi> and revealeth or manifeſteth it ſelf, in the Subſtance.</p>
                  <p n="69">69. The <hi>Magia</hi> is a Spirit, and the Subſtance is its Body: And yet both of them are but one, as Body and Soul is but one only Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p n="70">70. The <hi>Magia</hi> is the greateſt hidden Secret, for it is <hi>above</hi> Nature, it maketh Nature according to the Form of its Will; It is the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the Number Three or Trinity; underſtand; <hi>the Will</hi> in the Deſire to the Heart of God.</p>
                  <p n="71">71. It is the Fountain in the Divine Wiſdome, <hi>viz:</hi> a Deſire in the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

                  <p n="72">72. It is not the Majeſty, but the Deſire in the Majeſty, it is the Deſire of the Divine Power, not the Power it ſelf, but the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or the deſiring in the Power, it is not the Omnipotencie, but the Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſſe in the Power and Might, or Introducer into the Power and Might, the Heart of God is the Power, and the Holy Ghoſt is the <hi>Opening</hi> of that Power.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. Yet it is the <hi>Deſire</hi> in the Power, and alſo in the introducing or driving Spirit, For it hath in it the <hi>Fiat;</hi> whatſoever the Will-Spirit open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in it, that it driveth into a Subſtance through the harſh <hi>Aſtringency</hi> which is the Fiat; all according to the Modell of the Will; As the Will doth Modell it in the Wiſdome, ſo the deſiring <hi>Magia</hi> receiveth it, in; for it hath in its Property, the Imagination; as a Longing Lubet Luſt or Delight.</p>
                  <p n="74">74. The Imagination, is ſoft and pliable; and reſembleth the Water; but the Deſire, is rough and drie, like to hunger; it maketh that which is pliable to be hard, and ſo <hi>findeth it ſelf</hi> in all things; for it is the greateſt Subſtance in the Deity. It driveth the Abyſſe into the Byſſe or the Bottomleſſe into a Ground, and the Nothing into Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p n="75">75. In the <hi>Magia,</hi> do lye, all the Forms of the Subſtance of all Subſtances, it is a <hi>Mother</hi> in all the Three Worlds, and maketh every thing according to the Modell of its Will; it is <hi>not</hi> the Underſtanding, but it is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix or Maker according to the Underſtanding, and Suffers it ſelf to be uſed either to Good or to Evill.</p>

                  <p n="77">77. It is that which maketh divine Fleſh; and the Underſtanding, is from or <hi>proceeds</hi> out of the Wiſdome, for it is a knower or diſcerner of the Powers Colours and Vertues; the Underſtanding leadeth the true and right Spirit with a Bridle, for the Spirit is volatile and fleeting, and the Underſtanding <hi>is its Fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="78">78. The Spirit is not backſliding or departing away, ſo as to backſlide or <hi>depart</hi> from the Underſtanding, but it is the very Will of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; but the Sences or Thoughts in the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

                  <p n="79">79. For, the Senſes or Thoughts are the Flaſh out of the Fire-Spirit, and they bring into it in the Light, the Flame of the <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and in the Darkneſſe they introduce the Flaſh of the <hi>Terrour,</hi> like a fierce wrathfull flaſh of Fire.</p>
                  <p n="80">80.

                        <p n="32">32. In this kindling of the out-flown Will, is now the fift Property, the perceptibility of the Unity of God, <hi>viz:</hi> the <hi>Love;</hi> which in the Fire, becometh Moveable and <hi>deſirous;</hi> and Maketh in the Fire, that is, in the <hi>painfulneſſe,</hi> another Principle; <hi>viz:</hi> a Great Love fire; For it is the Cauſe and the <hi>Ground</hi> of the Light, ſo that in the Fires Eſſence, the Light Springeth up.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. And that, is the Eternall <hi>Originall</hi> of the <hi>Magia,</hi> which maketh in it ſelf, where Nothing is; it maketh out of Nothing Somewhat; and that only in it ſelf, and yet there that Seeking is alſo a Nothing, no other then meerly a <hi>Will.</hi>

NOW therefore ſeeing there is thus a Seeking in the Nothing, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it ſelf the Will to Somewhat, and that Will is a Spirit, and like a <hi>Thought:</hi> And that goeth forth out of the Seeking, and is the <hi>Seeker</hi> of the Seeking; for it findeth its <hi>Mother,</hi> which is the Seeking.</p>

                     <p n="7">7. And herein underſtand, how the Will is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and ſome other thing then the deſirous Seeking: For the Will is an <hi>imperceptible</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſible Life, but the Seeking becometh <hi>found</hi> by the Will, and is in the Will a <hi>Subſtance</hi> or Being.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. And then it becometh known or apprehended, that the Seeking is a <hi>Magia,</hi> and the willing a <hi>Magus;</hi> and that the Will is <hi>greater</hi> then its Mother that giveth affordeth or generateth it; for it is <hi>Lord</hi> in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the Mother becometh known to be Dumb <hi>ſilent</hi> or inopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and, the Will to be a Life, <hi>without Original.</hi>

                     <p n="10">10.

THus then ſeeing the Eternall Will is <hi>free</hi> from the Seeking, and yet the Seeking is <hi>not free</hi> from the Will, for the Will ruleth over the Seeking, therefore we apprehend the Will to be the Eternall <hi>Omnipotence;</hi> for it hath Nothing that is like it.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. And the Seeking is indeed a Moving, of the drawing or deſiring, but without underſtanding; and it hath a Life but without <hi>Ingenium</hi> or Wit: Now the Will ruleth the Life of the Seeking: and doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, what it will; and though it doth Somewhat, yet the ſame is not apprehended, till that ſame <hi>Subſtance</hi> manifeſteth or revealeth it ſelf by or through the Will; and then it becometh apprehended, what the Will hath made.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. And thus we apprehend the Eternall Will-Spirit, to be <hi>God,</hi> and the Moving Life of the Seeking to be <hi>Nature;</hi> for there is nothing ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and they are <hi>both</hi> without beginning, and the one is continually a cauſe of the other; and an Eternall Band: And thus, the Eternall-Will-Spirit, is an Eternall knowing of the Abyſſe; and the Life of the Seeking, an Eternall knowing of the willing.</p>

                     <p n="15">15. And the deſiring is a ſtrong or ſtern <hi>attracting,</hi> and yet hath No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but it ſelf: <hi>viz:</hi> the Eternity without Ground: Now that which is draweth magically, <hi>viz:</hi> its own deſiring to a <hi>Subſtance.</hi>

                        <pb facs="tcp:61437:100"/>16. For, now the <hi>Will</hi> taketh where Nothing is, it is a Lord and poſſeſſeth the ſame, and yet <hi>it ſelf</hi> is no Subſtance, and yet <hi>ruleth</hi> in the Subſtance; and the Subſtance maketh it deſirous, <hi>viz:</hi> of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. And becauſe then it becometh in it ſelf deſirous, therefore it is <hi>Magicall,</hi> and impregnateth it ſelf: <hi>viz:</hi> with <hi>Spirit,</hi> without Subſtance; for it is in the Originall no other then Spirit: thus it Maketh in its <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> only Spirit, and becometh pregnant of the Spirit; <hi>viz:</hi> the Eternall <hi>Skilfulneſſe</hi> of the Abyſſe, in the Omnipotence of the Life, <hi>without</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. And then being it is pregnant, therefore the generating goeth into it ſelf, and dwelleth in it ſelf: For the Eſſence of the <hi>other</hi> Life, <hi>cannot</hi> comprehend this impregnation, and be the ſuſtainer thereof; and <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> muſt the impregnation enter into it ſelf, and be its own ſuſtainer; <hi>viz:</hi> a <hi>Sonne,</hi> in the Eternall Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. And being this impregnation hath no Subſtance, therefore it ſelf is a Voice or Sound, <hi>viz:</hi> a <hi>Word</hi> of the Spirit, and continueth in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of the Spirit: For <hi>otherwiſe</hi> it hath no Seat or Place of poſſeſſion, but only in the Originall of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. And in this <hi>Word,</hi> there is <hi>yet</hi> a will, which there will goe forth into a <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and that Will is the Life of the Original Will, the ſame goeth forth out of the impregnation, <hi>viz:</hi> from the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the Will, forth, into the <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>Magia;</hi> that is, into <hi>Nature;</hi> and openeth the unintelligent life of the <hi>Magia,</hi> ſo that the ſame is a <hi>Myſterie,</hi> in which, an Underſtanding lyeth, Eſſentially; and thus getteth an <hi>Eſſentiall</hi> Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. Whereas, every Eſſence, is a ſecret <hi>Arcanum</hi> or a Myſterie of a whole Subſtance; and is thus a Comprehenſion, (<hi>viz:</hi> an Abyſſall <hi>Wonder</hi> of Eternity) where many lives, <hi>without Number,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Generated; and yet is together as it were but one only Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. And the <hi>Threefold</hi> Spirit without Subſtance, is the Maſter and Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſour thereof; and there yet it poſſeſſeth <hi>not</hi> the Nature-Subſtance; for it dwelleth in it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. The Word, is its <hi>Center,</hi> or place of poſſeſſion; and it ſtandeth in the Middeſt like a <hi>Heart.</hi>

                     <p n="32">32. And theſe are <hi>two Principles, in one only Originall,</hi> where each hath its Myſterie and its working; for the Nature-Life worketh to the <hi>Fire,</hi> and the Spirit-Life to the <hi>Light</hi> of the Brightneſſe and Glory.</p>

                     <p n="34">34. And thus to us is apprehenſible; that it is one only ſubſtantiality of Nature, <hi>like Water and Fire</hi> together; which thus ſtand as it were min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled one in another; where then it giveth a Light Blew or Azure Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: Like the <hi>flaſh</hi> of Fire.</p>

                     <p n="39">39.

                     </p>
                     <p n="41">41. And there then it comprehendeth the Seeking (underſtand the Looking-Glaſſe) and bringeth it into its Imagination, and findeth that the ſame <hi>is not</hi> its Life.</p>

                     <p n="43">43. Thus then the Seeking, ſeeketh the limit or utmoſt extent, of the Beginning; and goeth out from the Looking Glaſſe; and then is the Looking-Glaſſe <hi>Broaken;</hi> and the Breaking is a <hi>Turba; viz:</hi> a dying of the<note n="*" place="margin">Received Conceived or Formed Life.</note> Comprehenaed Life.</p>
                     <p n="44">44.

                     <p n="45">45.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>RIght</hi> Praying, is not a meer Cuſtome, that a Man needs only Speak or Say the Words of Prayer; no; ſuch ſpeaking of words, without <hi>hearty</hi> Conſideration Attention or Devotion and <hi>divine Deſire,</hi> is but an <hi>Outward</hi> thing; an outward forming or framing of words.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Mouth Imageth or contriveth its words of the Prayer, with the outward Power, of the <hi>Conſtellations</hi> or Starres and <hi>Elements,</hi> and maketh only a form or <hi>figure</hi> of the willing, wherein there is no work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power: For Nothing pleaſeth God, unleſſe what himſelf worketh, and doth, with a thing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For, God in the Prophet, <hi>complaineth</hi> of ſuch outward Mouth-prayer, or Lip-prayer, without Power; where he ſaith: <hi>With their lips they draw near to Me, but their Heart is farre from Me.</hi> Iſai 29.13.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Alſo, ſaith Chriſt: <hi>Not all that ſay:</hi> LORD, LORD; <hi>ſhall come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdome of Heaven, but they that doe the Will of my Father in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> Math. 7.21. And ſaith further in another Place; <hi>Without</hi> ME <hi>ye can doe nothing;</hi> John 15.5. He alone is the living Fountain, and the Throne of Grace, with and through which, we, with Prayer can enter or preſs before and into God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If we would pray aright, then we ſhould, I. <hi>Firſt:</hi> view and well conſider our ſelves, whither our Heart have Imaged or framed it ſelf into another Creature; and whether alſo ſuch deſire, which we, deſire, to obtain of God, be <hi>right:</hi> Or alſo, whether ſuch deſire, which we would bring to God in our Prayer, be <hi>againſt</hi> the profit or benefit and Love of our Neighbour: Or whether, we therein ſeek temporall Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to <hi>abridge</hi> our Neighbour therein, and to draw that which is his, to our ſelves: Or whether, we thereby deſire a <hi>Generall</hi> Common <hi>Love</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61437:108"/> Unity or Concord: Or whether, with ſuch Praying we ſeek only our own Profit and Gain, <hi>to our ſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. II. And <hi>Secondly:</hi> We ſhould well Conſider our ſelves; whether we alſo in our Prayer, deſire and Love any thing <hi>More</hi> or above the Mercy of God: Or whether, whatſoever we deſire of Temporall things, we deſire them only and <hi>alone</hi> from the divine hand and Co-working: Or whether we would, through our Skill Art Subtilty Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and <hi>Wit</hi> draw it to our ſelves, and ſo only pray to God for his<note n="*" place="margin">Or permiſſion</note> leave to have it; or whether, we relye upon our ſelves: or whether we would obtain it through the <hi>divine</hi> co-working; that we may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſay with a <hi>chearful</hi> heart: <hi>This God hath beſtowed or vouchſafed</hi> ME through his Fatherly Care and <hi>Providence:</hi> I have only been the Hand and the Inſtrument: Or: whether we will ſay; this I have brought to paſſe through my <hi>own</hi> Skill and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. III. <hi>Thirdly:</hi> we ſhould conſider; what we would doe with that, which we pray for and deſire from God: Whether we thereby only deſire to have the <hi>Honour</hi> and Highneſs of the World, for temporall <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> and Voluptuouſneſs; or whether, we would lay out that which God caſteth upon us with his Bleſſing through our Prayer, to <hi>his Honour</hi> and the <hi>Love</hi> of our <hi>Neighbour;</hi> and give it to him again: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we would alſo account our ſelves therein <hi>only</hi> to be Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and Servants or Miniſters in his Vineyard: as from whom, God will require an <hi>account</hi> of his Gifts, how faithfull we have been, therein.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. IV. <hi>Fourthly:</hi> we ſhould Conſider; that in this World we have nothing for our <hi>own:</hi> and that we our ſelves are not our own; but only, for a little while in this World, are <hi>Labourers,</hi> and beſides, ſtrange Gueſts or Pilgrims, only Officers of our God, over his Creation Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip and Creatures, and that whatſoever we work in, and doe, we doe it not for our <hi>ſelves</hi> only, but for God and our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And that we all are together but <hi>One</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Saviour; who himſelf is IN us ALL: and in that reſpect, that we ſhould have a Generall <hi>Common</hi> Love one towards another, and deſire<note n="†" place="margin">1 John 4.10, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>heartily</hi> to <hi>Love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as God</hi> in Chriſt our Saviour hath <hi>loved us:</hi> and that we will heartily and readily impart the Gifts which God hath given us <hi>through</hi> our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whether they be Earthly or Heavenly, to our fellow-Members; and hold <hi>together</hi> as the Tree in its Branches, or as the Earth with its Fruit or Productions doth; which willingly and readily giveth up it ſelf into all its Fruits, and loveth and <hi>beareth</hi> them all.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. V. <hi>Fiftly:</hi> we muſt Conſider; that we, of and from our own power, cannot rightly pray before God, as Chriſt ſaith: <hi>Without Me ye can doe nothing:</hi> Alſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; <hi>We know not what we ſhould pray as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61437:108"/> we ought</hi> before God: <hi>But the</hi> Holy <hi>Spirit it ſelf pleadeth for us</hi> migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily <hi>with unſpeakable Sighs,</hi> before God, as it pleaſeth him: Rom. 8.26.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Therefore, when we will pray to God our Heavenly Father, then we muſt call upon him, in the Name of his dear Sonne <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> for the Illumination of his holy Spirit; that he would <hi>forgive</hi> our Sinnes for his bitter Suffering and dying ſake, and give us that which is good and<note n="*" place="margin">Bliſsfull.</note> happy for us; we ſhould commit all whatſoever is <hi>Earthly</hi> to his Skill Cognizance and Will, and not <hi>only with Empty breath and words</hi> enter before God, when we would pray aright, and be heard: But with true right earneſt ſincere Repentance, and <hi>Converſion</hi> from our falſe or wicked Converſation: We muſt goe forth from all Falſhood, Pride or State, Covetouſneſs, Envy, Anger, and Contrariety or Oppoſition; and <hi>totally</hi> give up our Heart and Soul, to God the Holy Spirit; that he may be our Working of Repentance, and Power in the Prayer: That he may include or comprehend our willing and deſiring in himſelf, and bring it into GOD; that we may, dye away in the Death of Chriſt from our falſe or wicked <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>deſire,</hi> which is befallen us by inheritance, and in <hi>the Spirit of Chriſt in us</hi> riſe again and be born with a New Will Mind and Obedience, towards God: and forth on, walk in ſuch Power, in Righteouſneſs and <hi>Purity,</hi> with our Will and New Birth before God; as his Children; whom he hath dearly <hi>bought,</hi> through the <hi>Bloud</hi> and Death of his well-beloved Sonne, and hath new regenerated them <hi>in his Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. VI. <hi>Sixtly:</hi> Chriſtian Loving Reader; thou oughteſt well to conſider; <hi>What Prayer is;</hi> and <hi>why</hi> God Bids us to Pray; It is NOT ſuch a thing, as when a Man cometh before a Worldly King or Lord, when he hath miſdemeaned himſelf towards him, and Prayeth or Beggeth Grace and Pardon of him; and often times in heart thinketh much <hi>otherwiſe:</hi> NO; but it is a going forth out of our ſelves, that a Man, out of all his powers with all whatſoever he is, and whatſoever he poſſeſſeth; give himſelf up to God.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Yea; with right true Prayer, he giveth himſelf up to God, for a Propriety: He cometh with the Loſt<note n="†" place="margin">Luke 15.12.</note> 
                     <hi>Prodigall Sonne</hi> again to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into his firſt Native Country, and Inheritance, out of which our firſt Father <hi>Adam</hi> hath brought him.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. He hath no Naturall right more to the heavenly Goods, he hath with <hi>Adams</hi> going forth loſt them all, and with the Devils Whoredome <hi>conſumed</hi> them in Vanity: Whereupon now, he muſt in great <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Faith;</hi> in true <hi>Hope</hi> of the promiſed Grace in his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, come with the Loſt Sonne to God, and account himſelf unworthy of all Heavenly Goods by a Naturall right; and fall down before God his Eternall Father; and pray to him for the <hi>promiſed</hi> Mercy, in his Sonne <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that he will yet receive him again, as a <hi>hired Day-man</hi> and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61437:109"/> Labourer, into his Vine-yard; and will yet again give him <hi>heavenly</hi> Meat and Drink for his Fainting Hungry and Thirſty Soul; that he might no more need, with the Devils <hi>Swine, to Eat the Husks</hi> of Vanity Lying and Falſhood; and ſo periſh in unbelief without heavenly Power and Vertue.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. He muſt ſet open the Mouth of his hungry and thirſty Soul, in his Prayer, wide, towards the Grace and Mercy of God, with hearty ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and <hi>turning</hi> into the Grace, and totally and altogether give up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Grace of God: And then he will inſtantly <hi>hear</hi> in his <hi>Soul;</hi> that God will come to meet him with his Grace, and give the Grace which he offereth in Jeſus Chriſt <hi>into</hi> his Soul: So that the poor hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Soul, will powerfully and ſubſtantially <hi>receive,</hi> in it ſelf, whatſoever it deſireth and prayeth for, from God: <hi>viz:</hi> the Fleſh and Bloud, of Jeſus Chriſt: Which is offered or preſented to All <hi>hungry</hi> repenting Soules, out of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. He will rightly find in himſelf, how the Old Father of the Loſt Prodigall Sonne, <hi>cometh to meet</hi> the poor Converted Repenting Soul; and with his Love-<hi>falleth about its Neck</hi> of its Eſſence of the Life, and embraceth and <hi>kiſſeth it</hi> with his Love, and <hi>taketh it into his Armes;</hi> and in power ſaith to it: This is my beloved Sonne: This is my beloved Soul;<note n="*" place="margin">Luke 15.24, 31.</note> 
                     <hi>which I had Loſt: it was dead,</hi> and is become living again: Now ſlay the Lamb Jeſus Chriſt: It ſhall ſit with me in my Power <hi>at my Table;</hi> and Eat with me at my Supper or Meale prepared for me; of the true food of my Sonne Jeſus Chriſt; and ſhall Eternally rejoyce it ſelf with me.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And there will, the Seal <hi>Ring, viz:</hi> the dear and pretious Teſtament of the Covenant of God in the Bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>be put on</hi> to the Soul; and will through the Covenant and Sealing be received again for a Childe of God.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Therefore I ſay to the Chriſtian Reader, that praying is <hi>not only</hi> a Mouth-work or Lip-labour; as a Man cometh before a Lord, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth ſome temporall thing of him; or for the forgiveneſſe of his Guilt: God biddeth us to pray not for <hi>outward imputed</hi> Grace only, but for the filiall child-like <hi>operative</hi> Grace; where the Holy Spirit in the Merits of Chriſt prayeth and beggeth in our ſelves, whereby it maketh the Grace in us powerfull, and in ſuch working, alſo <hi>overthroweth</hi> the Sinne in us, and drowneth it in Chriſts death, deſtroyeth Hell, and bringeth forth the Gates of Eternall Life, <hi>viz:</hi> the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Chriſt or his payment of our Debt in us, quite through Gods Anger, and taketh away the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils might in us; and putteth Chriſt on to us; ſo that we in the Spirit and Merit of Chriſt<note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 8.15.</note> 
                     <hi>cry</hi> unto the Father of all Mercy and ſay; ABBA, loving <hi>Father.</hi>
                  </p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61437:109"/> with all <hi>Confidence</hi> we may <hi>pray to the Father,</hi> and he will give it unto us. Rom. 8.15. Epheſ. 3.11 Gal. 4.6.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. For the Giving and Receiving ſake, God biddeth us to pray and beg; as Chriſt ſaith: My <hi>Father will give the Holy Spirit to them that</hi> pray and <hi>ask him for it:</hi> Alſo: <hi>Ask and ſo ye ſhall receive, ſeek, and ſo ye ſhall find, knock and ſo it will be opened unto you,</hi> Luke 11.9.13.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Every Prayer, which doth <hi>not</hi> find and <hi>receive;</hi> is Cold and Luke-warme: and ſticketh in a hinderance of <hi>temporall</hi> Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things: That is; the Soul doth not <hi>clearly</hi> draw near to God: It will <hi>not totally</hi> give it ſelf up to God, but hangeth ſtill to Earthly Love, which holdeth it captive, that it cannot reach the City and Place of God.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. If a Man would pray aright, then he muſt, <hi>turn</hi> himſelf, <hi>away,</hi> from all Creatures, and with the Will and Mind clearly come before God: It muſt be in ſuch a Purpoſe and Earneſt Reſolution, as with the <hi>Publican</hi> in the Temple; and as with the forlorn <hi>loſt Sonne,</hi> which came thus to God.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. And though <hi>Reaſon</hi> in Fleſh and Bloud ſaith clearly No; thou wilt not be heard; thy <hi>Sinnes</hi> are too great, or it is not time now, ſtay a while; doe firſt this, or that, thou ſhalt have time and opportunity to doe that <hi>hereafter:</hi> Or elſe ſaith: Why doeſt thou pray, when thou canſt not come with thy deſire <hi>to God:</hi> Thou receiveſt no power into thee: Let not all this deceive thee: The Power <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="24">24. Whoſoever would pray aright, and with his deſire attain Gods Power and Spirit; muſt <hi>forgive</hi> all his Enemies heartily, and include them together in his Prayer: and pray to God, that he will <hi>convert</hi> them alſo; and be reconciled with them in his Love; that a Serpent might not continue in his heart, which ſhould hold him <hi>back,</hi> and tear the power of the Prayer from the Soul; as Chriſt ſaith: <hi>The Devill teareth the Word from their Hearts, that they believe not and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſaved:</hi> Luke 8.12. Alſo: <hi>When thou wilt offer thy Gift upon the Altar, and there remembereſt that thy Brother hath any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, then goe thy way firſt and reconcile thy ſelf with thy Brother: And then come and offer thy Gift:</hi> Math. 5.23, 24. Alſo in Our Father: <hi>Forgive us our Debts or Treſpaſſes as we forgive our Debters that treſpaſſe againſt us;</hi> Math. 6.12. That the Evill Enemy with the included Hate may not Sift or Tempt us, and <hi>hinder us:</hi> and bring us into Doubt.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. God requireth a clear <hi>empty</hi> and Naked Soul in Prayer: And though indeed it be ſurrounded with vanity, yet <hi>its Will</hi> ſhould come
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61437:110"/> clearly before God; that it might begin to work in its Will; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards alſo <hi>daily mortifie</hi> the Vanity of the Fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. So very <hi>firmly</hi> muſt the Will of the Soul, together with the deſire, be directed to God, that it ſay with <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he wreſtled with God the whole night: LORD <hi>I will not let thee goe unleſſe thou bleſſe me:</hi> Gen. 32.26.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. And though the heart as it were fainteth ſtaggereth and <hi>doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eth,</hi> and all manner of hinderances fall in, yet the Will muſt continue ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and firmly, Image <hi>imprint</hi> or apprehend, the Grace; and reſolve not to depart from it.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. And though the Devill driveth the Luſt of the Fleſh <hi>aloft,</hi> at which the Soul is <hi>terrified,</hi> and thinketh it is therefore caſt out from God; yet <hi>the Will</hi> ſhould then hang to the Grace; as a Child to the Mothers Breaſt, and Continually ſtrive againſt the Devill; and <hi>his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi> in Fleſh and Bloud; till at laſt it prevaileth; and in the Spirit of Chriſt, overcometh the Devill, and then afterwards <hi>he will find</hi> and ſee great Wonders in himſelf, and will know that it is true, that <hi>there is ſuch great Joy in Heaven concerning a Converting Soul, more then for Ninety Nine righteous which need not ſuch repentance,</hi> Luke 15.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Therefore, whoſoever will pray aright; muſt firmly Imagine or <hi>reſolve,</hi> that he will come to the Grace and Salvation and certainly attain that which he prayeth for.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. Therefore alſo his Prayer ſhould be ſo directed, that it <hi>runneth not</hi> contrary to the Ordinance of God, but ſhould think and reſolve that in his Prayer he will co-work <hi>with God:</hi> As the Wood of the Tree co-worketh with the Trees power, ſo alſo ſhould the deſire only work with Gods Power: Elſe its Prayer is only a working in the <hi>Shell</hi> or <hi>Bark</hi> of the right Lifes Tree, for it worketh therewith only outwardly in the Elements, and NOT inwardly in and with God.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. But he that prayeth aright, worketh inwardly with God; and generateth or bringeth forth outwardly <hi>Good</hi> Fruits: as the Tree bringeth forth its power, and letteth it ſelf be <hi>ſeen</hi> with the Power in the Fruit: and ſo alſo the true divine Power in Man letteth it ſelf be ſeen outwardly with or by <hi>Good Works</hi> and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. Elſe there is no Faith there, <hi>unleſſe</hi> the Work follow: Elſe the Prayer is but <hi>diſſembling</hi> Hypocriſie: and maketh only an outward form, and reacheth not the Place or City of God.</p>
                  <p>This I would not Conceal or forbear to intimate to my good Friends and fellow <hi>Brethren</hi> in Chriſtian Love out of my little <hi>Cabinet-Treaſure,</hi> as a Chriſtian Information how a Man ſhould be prepared to Pray.</p>

                  <p>And would have theſe following Prayers <hi>written for Every day in the week</hi> (wherein then a Man may therewith fit his particular State according to his <hi>occaſion</hi>) only for the <hi>Stirring up</hi> and awakening of the Good Gifts which before-hand are in you all: Not to begin once more from the Ground and Beginning of Chriſtian Teaching, but for an <hi>Exerciſe</hi> and awakening.</p>

                     <hi>An Introduction.</hi> How a Man ſhould <hi>prepare</hi> himſelf to ſuch Order Ordinance and Exerciſe, to <hi>right Praying.</hi>

                     <salute>Chriſtian Loving Reader.</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p n="33">33. <hi>RIght Praying,</hi> is in right Earneſt Sincerity; and it muſt be <hi>earneſt,</hi> elſe it availeth nothing in the Preſence of God: For if we will rightly Pray; then we muſt think no otherwiſe, but that <hi>we ſtand</hi> before <hi>Gods</hi> clear and bright Countenance, before the holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> and before the <hi>Quires</hi> of his holy <hi>Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="34">34. And that God in our Prayer <hi>proveth</hi> our Soul, Spirit, and Heart; and beholdeth our Will totally moſt inwardly, <hi>whether</hi> it be totally <hi>inclined</hi> to him, whether the Will have totally given it ſelf up to him.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. And if that be ſo, then He toucheth the Will with the <hi>Power</hi> of his holy Spirit, and rouſeth it, that it may become <hi>rightly</hi> deſirous and hungry after the Grace; ſo that then he beginneth earneſtly to go OUT from ſelf and preſſeth or penetrateth INTO Gods Compaſſion Pitty and <hi>Mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="36">36. For, in own-<hi>ſelf Power,</hi> the Will is <hi>too too weak:</hi> but, when the Divine Power toucheth it; then it becometh <hi>awakened;</hi> ſo that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh fiery and rightly deſirous; <hi>in which deſire,</hi> God himſelf work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: and then Man Speaketh rightly with God, and God ſpeaketh <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively</hi> with the Soul of that Man.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. Such Speaking or <hi>Working</hi> is nothing elſe, but that, the poor Soul eateth of Gods Mercy, which he hath turned to us again through the Death of Chriſt; and quickneth or <hi>refreſheth</hi> it ſelf with the <hi>Balſame</hi> of divine Love <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> wherein it becometh Strong againſt the <hi>Temptation</hi> or Aſſaults of the Devill.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. For, the <hi>Divine Hearing</hi> is the Grace-Power, which God hath in the Name JESUS introduced into the Humanity again, and opened again to us ALL an Open Gate to his <hi>hearing;</hi> whereby we can <hi>hear</hi> God Speak operatively in us, how he inſpeaketh or <hi>inſpireth</hi> his Mercifulneſs into us, through that opened Grace-Gate: and on the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61437:111"/> other ſide, the Soul ſpeaketh through the ſame open Gate in it ſelf with God: And becometh in ſuch inſpeaking or inſpiration fed and <hi>quickened</hi> from Gods out-ſpeaking, alſo enlightened and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. For it eateth of the <hi>oui-breathing</hi> of God, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come MAN; <hi>viz:</hi> the Fleſh and Bloud of Chriſt, after that kind and way, as an Hearb eateth the Suns Power and Vertue in it ſelf, whence it is tinctured and balſamed and becometh <hi>good,</hi> ſo that it groweth and bloſſometh; ſo alſo the Soul from the divine Sun; whence it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh full of Light and powerfull.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. This now is the profit, fruit, and <hi>benefit;</hi> of right praying; which profit or benefit, no outward Mouth, and no Will averted from God <hi>can attain,</hi> but only the inverted, <hi>which</hi> totally giveth it ſelf up to God.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. Now if any would have this done, then muſt the Will turn <hi>away from all</hi> other Creatures and from all Earthly things and nakedly ſtand before God, that the Work or Frame of the Creatures, or of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it will pray for, from God, in Temporall things; <hi>may only follow after,</hi> in the Fleſh; and ſtand <hi>behinde</hi> the pure Will, that the pure Will, may bring the <hi>Neceſſities</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> before God, and that the Fleſh it ſelf, may NOT co-work <hi>with its Luſt,</hi> elſe it bringeth earthly Luſt into the divine Souliſh working.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. Therefore, there belongeth alwayes, to right Earneſt Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if we <hi>would</hi> obtain any thing from God; a right true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and in-turned <hi>Humility:</hi> For right Praying is a recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of that which the Soul deſireth, concerning which Chriſt ſaith: <hi>From henceforth the Kingdome of Heaven ſuffereth vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and the violent take it by force to themſelves.</hi> Math. 11.12.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. For which <hi>cauſe,</hi> I will ſet down a brief Form of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion or <hi>Preparation;</hi> how a Man ſhould prepare himſelfe, when he will bring his ſhort Prayer and <hi>Requeſts</hi> before God.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. For he may as well be heard in a <hi>ſhort</hi> Prayer as with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words, if his <hi>heart</hi> ſtand right in the preſence of God; It needeth <hi>not</hi> long Prayers or many words, but only a Beleiving or <hi>faithfull,</hi> repentant Soul; which with totall Earneſtneſſe, giveth it ſelf up into the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God into Gods Compaſſion: For <hi>one onely ſigh</hi> worketh with God; if the Will ſtandeth nakedly or purely before God; and hath caſt away from it the <hi>Earthly</hi> Garment, <hi>viz:</hi> the falſe or wicked Luſt: This for an Intimation to the Reader: and for a quickening ſtirring to him.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. For, there needeth not to be uſed <hi>juſt ſuch a Form</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but the Holy Spirit will well enough make a <hi>Form</hi> for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61437:112"/> him in the heart, when the Will, in <hi>true earneſt</hi> Sincerity turneth it ſelf to God.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. Only for an <hi>Introduction,</hi> to every one who doth not <hi>yet</hi> know, how a true Prayer ſhould be <hi>fitted,</hi> I will ſet down this Confeſſion to <hi>direct</hi> his Soul therewith; and I will commit the work of Confeſſion together with the Praying, <hi>to the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in every Soul;</hi> which is truly and rightly Earneſt: He will well enough make for him a Confeſſion and <hi>Prayer;</hi> if any doe but earneſtly ſincerely and rightly come to the Gate where GOD the LORD, <hi>in Man</hi> Speaketh <hi>operatively:</hi> Then he will find it ſo.</p>

                     <p n="48">48. I poor, unworthy ſinfull Man, come upon the <hi>invitation</hi> of thy Word, and acknowledge to thee, that I am not worthy of ſuch Grace, which thou offereſt us: For I Stick in the Slime of <hi>Vanity,</hi> and am Laden with vain Luſts of the Fleſh and own-ſelf Will; my <hi>Sinnes</hi> have <hi>capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated</hi> and obſcured me, ſo that I neither taſt nor ſee thy Grace <hi>in me;</hi> alſo I have no Right Truſt or Confidence nor Faith towards thee, and have totally given my ſelf up, into the vanity of the World and of the Fleſh: and am compaſſed about <hi>therewith.</hi>

                     <p n="49">49. I have defiled my fair bright Garment, which thou haſt put on to me in the <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> with the Luſt of the Fleſh; and lye in the Devils <hi>Net,</hi> captive in thy fierce Wrath.

                           <p n="4">4. For, though perhaps Reaſon looketh thus upon it ſelf in this World, and in its<note n="*" place="margin">Or Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</note> 
                              <hi>Viſibility,</hi> findeth no other ground, yet it percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in it Self a <hi>deſire</hi> after a higher Ground wherein it might reſt.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. For it underſtandeth that it is proceeded out of a Super-naturall Ground, and that there muſt be a GOD, who hath brought it into a Life and Willing; and is<note n="†" place="margin">Or troubled or terrified.</note> aſtoniſhed in it Self at its own willing, and <hi>judgeth</hi> it ſelf in the willing of Evill, for unrighteous.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Though indeed it doth that unrighteouſneſſe, yet it complains againſt it <hi>ſelf,</hi> and is afraid of a Judgement, which it ſeeth not: Which <hi>ſignifieth,</hi> that the hidden God who hath brought himſelf into Nature, dwelleth in it, and reproveth it for its Evill wayes, and that, the ſame, (hidden God)<note n="*" place="margin">Or Cannot.</note> muſt not be the Nature of perceptibility; ſeeing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>ſeeth him not</hi> nor apprehendeth him.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. On the other ſide, the forſaken Reaſon, which in its apprehenſion is here vexed with wrong or unrighteouſneſs in <hi>Miſery,</hi> findeth a deſire in it ſelf, yet <hi>more,</hi> to forſake it ſelf, and giveth it ſelf willingly up to <hi>ſuffering.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="8">8. But paſſeth in its unrighteous Suffering, into a <hi>Hope,</hi> that, that which hath created it will take it from ſuffering, into it ſelf, and deſireth to reſt in that, which is <hi>not</hi>
                              <note n="†" place="margin">Paſſive.</note> paſſible, and ſeeketh Reſt in that which it is not, in it ſelf.</p>
                           <p n="9">9.

                           <p n="10">10. And therefore it giveth it ſelf up to the ſuffering, that the power of the painfulneſs, ſhould kill its ſuffering, and that it, in its Life, might through the Death, of the <hi>dying</hi> of it ſelf, in that it is a painfull Life, <hi>enter</hi> into the unpainfull and impaſſible.</p>
                           <p n="11">11.

                           <p n="15">15. If the Naturall Life had <hi>no</hi> Contrariety or Oppoſition, and were without a limit, then it would <hi>never</hi> ask or enquire after its Ground, out of which it is proceeded, and ſo the hidden God would continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known or <hi>unapprehended</hi> by the Naturall Life.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. Alſo, if there were no Contrariety or Oppoſition in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Life, then there would alſo be <hi>no perceptibi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="17">17. For, a thing that hath but one Will, that, hath no Diviſibility or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parability: For if it perceiveth not a Contrary or Oppoſite willing, which cauſeth it to the driving of the Motion: then it ſtandeth ſtill.</p>
                           <p n="18">
                              <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61437:133"/>18. For, ONE only thing knoweth no More but of ONE: And though it is in it ſelf GOOD, yet it knoweth <hi>neither</hi> of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill nor of Good, for it hath nothing in it ſelf that maketh it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible.</p>

Thus alſo, we may Philoſophate concerning the <hi>Will of God,</hi> and ſay: That if the hidden God, who is but ONE only Subſtance and Will, had not with his Will brought forth himſelf OUT of himſelf, and brought forth himſelf out of the Eternall knowledge or Skill in the Temperament, into <hi>diviſibility</hi> of the willing, and had not introduced that ſame diviſibility into an incluſibility, to a <hi>Naturall</hi> and Creaturely Life, and that the ſame diviſibility in the Life, did <hi>not</hi> ſtand in <hi>ſtrife:</hi> how would then, the hidden Will of God, which, in it ſelf, is but ONE only: Be manifeſted or <hi>Revealed to</hi> HIMSELF.</p>
                           <p n="20">20. How can there be in ONE only Will a knowledge or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of it ſelf?

The humane Life, is,<note n="*" place="margin">Placed, put into or framed into.</note> ſet in an Object or <hi>reflex</hi> Image of the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> Will, in and with which, God willeth; and the Earthly Creatures are ſet in an Object or Repreſentation of the <hi>humane</hi> Life, in and with which, Man ſhould Will: Mans willing ſhould with Gods willing, will, and <hi>rule, over</hi> all and Every Naturall and Creaturely Life: It ſhould not ſtand in a Beaſtiall Eſſence, but in Divine.</p>
                           <p n="21">21. Though indeed Man with the Life was<note n="†" place="margin">Or framed into Nature.</note> ſet in <hi>Nature,</hi> yet his Nature was a <hi>Temperature,</hi> and his Life a houſe of the divine Will.</p>
                           <p n="22">22. But ſeeing now the Life muſt ſtand during this Time in the Earthly Eſſence, and that it <hi>cannot</hi> be rid of it; therefore a Man ſhould look to the <hi>Threefold kind</hi> and Manner of the Life, according to the <hi>Three Principles;</hi> with which, or what, Ground of the Life, Man caſts himſelf into the <hi>Super-cogitative</hi> Subſtance of God; and how that can and may be done.</p>
                           <p n="23">23. Chriſt ſaith; John 15. verſe 5. <hi>Without me ye can doe nothing; No Man can of his own ability,</hi> attain or reach into the higheſt Ground, unleſſe his innermoſt Ground of the firſt Principle, as or according to the Lifes Imagibility, ſink down into the Incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Grace of God, and according to that Ground, in divine <hi>hope,</hi> ſtand ſtill from own ſelf-willing, and totally with the willing give up it ſelf to God, in ſuch a way, as that its <hi>willing,</hi> will ſpeak no more according to this Ground, but only what <hi>God</hi> ſpeaketh and willeth through this Ground: and then it is at the higheſt Limit.</p>
                           <p n="24">
                              <pb n="17" facs="tcp:61437:139"/>24. Now if it be <hi>poſſible</hi> that it may ſtand ſtill for an hour or leſſe, from its own moſt inward <hi>Self</hi>-willing and Speaking: Then will the <hi>divine</hi> willing in ſpeak or inſpire it: Through which in-ſpeaking, Gods willing includeth its willing in it ſelf; and in-ſpeaketh or inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth into the Image-like Naturall Eſſentiall <hi>outward</hi> Reaſon-Life: and diſſolveth and enlighteneth the Earthly Imaging of Reaſons willing; ſo that inſtantly, the Super-cogitative, or Super-ſenſuall divine Life and willing, Sprouteth or Vegetateth and Incentrateth it ſelf in the Reaſons willing.</p>
                           <p n="25">25. For, as little as the own-ſelf willing of the Life, in the ſelf-hood, and the willing <hi>averſe</hi> and Apoſtate from Gods Willing, in Nature may ſtand ſtill for the <hi>twinckling</hi> of an Eye, from its working, unleſſe it ſink it ſelf down beyond and without all Nature; ſo little alſo, may the Divine Speaking, in the Life reſigned or forſaken to the Ground or bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, ſtand ſtill from <hi>its working.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="26">26. For, if the Life ſtand ſtill from its <hi>own</hi> willing, then it ſtandeth in the <hi>Abyſſe</hi> of Nature and Creature, in the Eternall OUT-ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, and <hi>then</hi> God ſpeaketh therein.</p>
                           <p n="27">27. For, from Gods ſpeaking, is the Life, gone-OUT and come into Body, and is no other then an <hi>Image-like</hi> Will of God.</p>
                           <p n="28">28. Now if it be ſo, that the <hi>own</hi>-ſelf Imaging, and willing, ſtand ſtill, then the <hi>Divine</hi> Imaging and willing riſeth up, for that which is will-leſſe or void of willing, that is, with the Nothing, ONE and the SAME thing; and is without and beyond or diſtinct from all Nature, which Abyſſe, <hi>is God himſelf.</hi>

                           <p n="29">29. Seeing then the Abyſſe, <hi>viz:</hi> God, is an Eternall Speaking, <hi>viz:</hi> an OUT-breathing of himſelf, therefore alſo is the Abyſſe in-ſpoken to the reſigned or <hi>forſaken</hi> Life: For the breathing of the Abyſſe ſpeaketh through the <hi>ſtill</hi>-ſtanding Ground of the Life.</p>
                           <p n="30">30.

                           <p n="33">33. For the divine Science or<note n="*" place="margin">Or Root.</note> Skill, is through the <hi>Self</hi> Imaging of the <hi>Self</hi>-willing turned into an Earthly beaſtiall property, and is, as to the Body, an Evill <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and as to the Will an <hi>apoſtate</hi> falſe Will, which willeth not with God; juſt after the manner of the Devill, which ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thus in own <hi>ſelf</hi> Imaging of the Senſitive or Cogitative Knowledge or Skill.</p>
                           <p n="34">34.

                           <p n="35">35. Behold a Similitude; for inſtance the Sun: When an Hearb hath not Sap, the Beames of the Sun, whence it groweth; burn it; but if it have Sap, the Sun <hi>warmeth</hi> it: So alſo in the Life of the Eſſence in Man, if the ſame hath not ENS from Gods <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and Love; <hi>viz</hi> from the Eternall ONE, then it impreſſeth or compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it ſelf into a fierce wrathfull fiery ſharpneſs, ſo that the Mind is totally Rough, Hungry Covetous Envious and Stinging, and ſuch a <hi>Falſe</hi> or Evill Senſe or <hi>Thought</hi> and Will goeth alſo afterwards out of the Life <hi>into</hi> the Body, and into all its Subſtance or <hi>Matters</hi> and Work.</p>
                           <p n="36">36. Thus ſuch Fiery Covetous Envious Kind or Manner with the ſharp Senſe or Thought of the Life <hi>ſcattereth</hi> or breaketh <hi>all</hi> that is <hi>Good;</hi> as alſo there is danger in all that it hath to do with: For it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

                           <p n="37">37. But if it be ſo, that the fiery Life <hi>may Eat</hi> of divine Love: Then it is a Similitude, of the Light, which, as it preſſeth and goeth forth from the Fire: ſo alſo, preſſeth the right Life, forth from the fiery kind of matter, with a New Spirit and Willing of <hi>divine</hi> Love, <hi>in it,</hi> and is <hi>no more</hi> receiving, as the Fires kind is, but giving.</p>
                           <p n="38">38. For, the Love willing giveth it ſelf forth, as the Light out of the Fire, which giveth it ſelf into all things, and <hi>worketh</hi> GOOD, in ALL.</p>
                           <p n="39">39. If the Sun did ſhine <hi>no more</hi> in the Deep of the World; then would the Spirit of the World, <hi>Spiritus Mundi,</hi> in the Sharpneſſe of the Conſtellations or <hi>Aſtrum,</hi> in the Sulphureous Mercureall kind in the Four Elements, be <hi>totally</hi> ſtern, rough, drie, harſh, thick, dark and hard, and then all and every Life in the Elements, would goe to the Ground, and <hi>Men</hi> would ſoon <hi>ſee</hi> what Hell and Gods Anger are.</p>
                           <p n="40">40. Thus alſo in like manner: <hi>as the outward Man,</hi> is a <hi>Limus</hi> of the Outward Elementary World, whoſe Life ſtandeth in the Sunnes and Starres power and vertue; <hi>and the Body,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Earth,</hi> is a Coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit of the World; and if that, in the Nutriment, in the food, <hi>might not</hi> have the Suns Light-love-power, it would become <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally</hi> Evill Fiery and Mortall; and the outward Life <hi>muſt</hi> to the Ground: Thus alſo in like manner, is the Soul a <hi>Limus</hi> of the Spirituall inward World <hi>ex Myſterio Magno,</hi> out of the Great Myſterie: <hi>viz:</hi> out of the <hi>Exit</hi> or <hi>Object</hi> of divine Skill and Knowledge; which muſt take its Nutriment out of the Great Myſterie <hi>ex Myſterio Magno</hi> of divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Knowledge.</p>
                           <p n="41">41. Is it ſo now, that it <hi>cannot</hi> have the ENS of divine Love for its Food, ſo that it breaketh it ſelf off, from the <hi>Abyſſe, viz:</hi> from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation or <hi>forſakenneſſe,</hi> then it becometh alſo thus Sharp Fiery Dark Rough Stinging Envyous, Enemicitious Oppoſite and a totall diſquieting of it ſelf; and bringeth it ſelf into a <hi>Mortall dying</hi> fierce wrathfull Source Quality or Torment, which is its <hi>Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> wherein it periſheth or corrupteth; as the Devill did and all wicked Men doe.</p>
                           <p n="42">42. But if it be ſo, that this Fire-Source or <hi>Quality may</hi> again attain divine Love, <hi>viz:</hi> the Subſtantiall Light of God; and receive the ſame into it ſelf, then this Souliſh Fire-Source becometh <hi>changed</hi> into a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Joy, into the Praiſe of God.</p>
                           <p n="43">43. But without Converted willing, if <hi>that,</hi> cannot ſtand ſtill from its ſterne Impreſſion and Incluſion, <hi>it is</hi> NOT <hi>poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. As the Senſes or <hi>Thoughts</hi> flow forth <hi>out</hi> of the Mind and yet the totall Mind is but ONE only: So alſo was the Eternall ONE, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the out-flowing of the willing, and that is ſignified by this ſaying. <hi>In the Beginning was the</hi> WORD.</p>

                     <p n="12">12. The DESIRE is the Ground and beginning of the Nature, of the Inventibility or Perceptibility of the <hi>own</hi> ſelf will, for therein is the Seperability of the Unity brought into Receptibility, out of which the ſeperabilities of the Will are brought into <hi>perceptibility</hi> of a ſelf-hood, wherein the true <hi>Creaturely,</hi> Perceptible, Angelicall and Souliſh Life, is underſtood.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. For, the WILL of the Eternall ONE is unperceptible, without inclination to any thing; for, it hath nothing to which it can incline it ſelf, <hi>but only</hi> in it ſelf; therefore thus it bringeth it ſelf forth out of it ſelf, and <hi>bringeth</hi> the Efflux of its Unity into Multiplicity, and into Reception to SELF-HOOD, <hi>viz:</hi> to a Place of a Nature out of which Properties ariſe originally.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. For, every Property hath its own Seperatour Divider and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker in it ſelf, and is in it ſelf, totall or entire, according to the Property of the <hi>Eternall</hi> UNITY.</p>
                     <p n="15">15.

                           <p n="53">53. Man cannot ſay of this Power, that it is Elementary, as alſo the <hi>Bloſſom</hi> is not, the Elements are only a dwelling-houſe and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

                           <p n="54">54. For, from the Tincture, goeth the Power forth through the Motion of the <hi>Groſſe</hi> Elementary Spirit, and bringeth it ſelf thereby into a perceptibility, <hi>viz:</hi> into <hi>Taſt</hi> and <hi>Smell:</hi> For the Smell is nothing elſe; but the perceptibility of the <hi>Tincture,</hi> through which the Efflux of divine Power Manifeſteth or Revealeth it ſelf: and thus receiveth perceptibility.</p>
                           <p n="55">55. The Sharpneſſe of the Smell is indeed Elementary, but the true power and vertue IN the ſharpneſs of the Smell is the Tincture, for the Motion of a thing is not the higheſt ground of the Power, but that out of which <hi>the cauſe</hi> of the Motion cometh.</p>
                           <p n="56">56. The <hi>Medicus,</hi> (Phyſician), <hi>uſeth</hi> a ſtrong or well Smelling Hearb for his Medicaments or Medicines; but the Smell, <hi>viz:</hi> the Sharpneſſe of the Smell, is <hi>not</hi> the <hi>Cure,</hi> which Cureth the <hi>Patient</hi> in his Sickneſs, but that is the <hi>Cure,</hi> from whence ſuch <hi>Balſam</hi> or Smell ariſeth originally, <hi>viz:</hi> the Tincture, which Imprinteth or Imageth it ſelf in ſuch Balſam.</p>
                           <p n="57">57. Chriſt ſaith: <hi>to the</hi> FIG-TREE <hi>be thou withered:</hi> (Math. 21. verſe 19.)

                           <p n="58">58. So the like alſo is to be underſtood concerning <hi>Faith:</hi> the Confeſſion and <hi>Conſent</hi> or Agreement concerning a Thing is not the right true Faith, much leſſe the Science or <hi>Knowledge;</hi> but that is the true Faith out of which the Confeſſion proceedeth, <hi>viz:</hi> the <hi>opened Spirit</hi> of God, in the inward ground of the Soul, which with the Confeſſion <hi>imageth</hi> it ſelf in the pronounced Word, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it ſelf viſible in the outward, and worketh with the viſible Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Body,</hi> and demonſtrateth it ſelf outwardly, ſo that a Man underſtandeth, that Gods Spirit, in the <hi>Works</hi> of Faith, co-worketh.</p>
                           <p n="59">59. Even as, it worketh with and through, the power of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary World, and maketh it ſelf <hi>viſible</hi> through the Subſtance of this World with an Object or Repreſentation: ſo that all whatſoever I look upon, be it Evill or Good; yet I can with truth ſay; here, by, or as to, this thing, the hidden Spirit of the Seperatour of all Things or Subſtances, <hi>Imaged</hi> it ſelf in a property, and hath here made to it ſelf, an Object or <hi>Image</hi> according to its Efflux, either according to Evill or God; all according to the properties of Nature, according to Heat or Cold, according to harſh bitter ſweet or ſoure, or <hi>how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever</hi> it be.</p>

Thus in all ſuch Imaging, only outwardly, there is ſuch an Elementary kind or manner of thing, <hi>viz: ſuch</hi> a Brimſtone and Salt: But in the inward ground in the <hi>Tincture</hi> it is Good and Profitable, and belongeth to its Similitude for <hi>Nutriment</hi> of the Life; which as to the Aſtrall and Elementary kind, ſtandeth in all Properties accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its <hi>outward</hi> Ground.</p>

                     <p>This I deſire you to Conſider further of: yet that it be done as is above mentioned; Elſe, I ſhall be as <hi>ſilent</hi> or mute to you, and yet the blame or fault not be mine.</p>
                     <p n="76">76. God is neither Nature nor Creature, as to what he is in himſelf: Neither this nor that, neither High nor Deep; He is the Abyſſe, and Byſſe or Ground of all Subſtances o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Things. <hi>An Eternall</hi> ONE, wherein is no Ground nor Place: He is to the Creature, in its ability, a NOTHING: And yet is through ALL.</p>
                     <p n="77">77. Nature and Creature, is <hi>his</hi> Somewhat, wherewith he maketh himſelf viſible, perceptible, and inventible, <hi>both</hi> according to the Eternity and Time.</p>
                     <p n="78">78. All things are Exiſted through <hi>divine</hi> Imagination, and doe yet ſtand in ſuch a Birth or Geniture, Condition or Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="79">
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61437:170"/>79. Alſo the Four Elements have ſuch a Ground from the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Eternall ONE. Concerning which I will here ſet down a Table, how the one <hi>unfoldeth</hi> or out-breatheth it ſelf out of the other.</p>
                     <p n="80">80. In the Annexed Table, is the Ground of All Secret My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of divine Manifeſtation or Revelation, deſcribed; to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of. The <hi>underſtanding of which</hi> is not in Natures own ſelf ability, <hi>without</hi> Gods Light: But to thoſe, who ſtand in the Light, it may well be underſtood; and without that it is Childiſh.</p>
                     <p n="81">81. As alſo, in my writings theſe things are declared ſufficiently and largely; and here only in <hi>brief</hi> compriſed, and repreſented in a Scheme or Figure.</p>
                     <p n="82">82. Thus Sirs, I commend you to the Salutation of the Love of JESUS CHRIST, who through his aſpect and ſalutation, is himſelf the <hi>Key,</hi> to the underſtanding of this Table.</p>
